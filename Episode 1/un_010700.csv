un_010700_0020#0,"""I'm Tea, and just for clarification this is my stupid sister."""
un_010700_0030#0,"""I'm not stupid! I actually got new information that no one knows; about Darkers this time!"""
un_010700_0040#0,"""Isn't it weird when you think about it? Why Darkers attack ARKS and how they know to attack us?"""
un_010700_0050#0,"""No mater how you look at them, they're thinking something."""
un_010700_0060#0,"""Turns out there's a reason in the physiology for why they tend to attack us over other native creatures."""
un_010700_0070#0,"""That reason turns out to be within ARKS; it's because we use photons as weapons."""
un_010700_0090#0,"""It turns out they can sense photons and are drawn to them!"""
un_010700_0100#0,"""That also seems to be the reason why they attack our ships directly sometimes!"""
un_010700_0110#0,"""To summarize, ARKS fighting actually draws more Darkers!"""
un_010700_0120#0,"""To think on the extreme, it's possible to believe that there may not be Darkers if there were no ARKS!"""
un_010700_0130#0,"""...what?"""
un_010700_0140#0,"""What? Did I actually manage to say something intelligent for once?"""
un_010700_0170#0,"""...this may be worth investigating some more."""
un_010700_0180#0,"""Anyways! It looks like this is all the information we have for now! Until next time!"""
un_010700_0190#0,"""I may actually be looking forward to it too..."""
