st_010395_0010#0,"""As expected, the Dragonkin are really strong. And you're not too shabby yourself for dealing with them so easily."""
st_010395_0020#0,"""Lately, the Dragonkin have been unusually aggressive towards the ARKS. It wasn't always this way."""
st_010395_0030#0,"""The ARKS and Dragonkin actually communicated to an extent."""
st_010395_0040#0,"""We've translated their language, so we should be able to understand them."""
