ra_010230_0020#0,"""Whichever you like, I'll tell you more than you want to know!"""
ra_010230_0030#0,"""Sorry, but it looks like Patty is fond of you."""
ra_010230_0040#0,"""Probably because you're the only one to ever stop and listen to her."""
ra_010230_0050#0,"""Don't worry. I gather all of the information, and it's not like we'll charge you."""
ra_010230_0060#0,"""But it would be nice if Patty weren't so hyper all the time."""

ra_010230_0080#0,"""You never listen to anything but the sound of your own voice."""

ra_010230_0150#0,"""Stronger members are often rewarded more than those with good intentions, so it can't be helped."""
