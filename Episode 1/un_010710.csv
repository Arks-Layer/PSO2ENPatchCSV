un_010710_0020#0,"""This is Tea. There are a lot of things I want to say, but I'll keep it in."""
un_010710_0030#0,"""Tea, you need to be more honest. If you have something to say, I'll take it all from you!"""
un_010710_0035#0,"""Hey? Why did you start charging a tech!?"""
un_010710_0040#0,"""You said you would take it didn't you?"""
un_010710_0050#0,"""It's said that before when there were a lot of ARKS, mock battles were held and many fell victim to them."""
un_010710_0060#0,"""No good! Stop! There aren't that many ARKS now!"""
un_010710_0070#0,"""Right, information! That's what we came here for, remember?"""
un_010710_0080#0,"""When there were a lot more ARKS, classes were divided into much smaller echelons."""
un_010710_0090#0,"""There was a more aggressive Hunter class and a close-up Ranger class and a lot more!"""
un_010710_0100#0,"""When the number of ARKS dropped, the class definitions were broadened, but I'd really like to see those types again!"""
un_010710_0110#0,"""But recently, the number of ARKS has been steadily growing so the division of classes might increase as well."""
un_010710_0120#0,"""But on the other hand, the more ARKS there are, the greater the number of Darkers there are!"""
un_010710_0130#0,"""Thus the reason for the mock battles!"""
un_010710_0140#0,"""Right? Gotta go find some information, later!"""
un_010710_0150#0,"""Hey Patty, I mean stupid sister! Come back and take it!"""
