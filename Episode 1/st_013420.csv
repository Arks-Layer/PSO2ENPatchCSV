st_013420_0010#0,"""Looks like we finished with one area. This looks like a break point."""
st_013420_0020#0,"""But still I'm amazed that they'd hold the championship with this many Darkers on it."""
st_013420_0030#0,"""I wouldn't say that it's too out of control, but still I find it somewhat uncanny."""
st_013420_0040#0,"""This feels more like a normal mission that it does like an actual event."""
st_013420_0050#0,"""But still, I wonder why I have such a bad feeling about this..."""
st_013420_0060#0,"""No, I wouldn't say bad. Scary, yet somewhat nostalgic. I really don't know how this is going to play out."""
st_013420_0070#0,"""Hello participants! If everyone enjoying themselves!?"""
st_013420_0080#0,"""Hey Huey! I want to join too! Why can't I participate?"""
st_013420_0090#0,"""You're part of the event staff aren't you? Why don7t you read the current status?"""
st_013420_0100#0,"""The current lead is the pair of the Ranger Afin and <%me>!"""
st_013420_0110#0,"""I have a feeling that I've heard that name before somewhere..."""
st_013420_0120#0,"""They're both new ARKS, but they've shown a lot of promise! Keep doing your best!"""
st_013420_0122#0,"""Following them is the pair of the Hunter Ohza, and the Force Marlu!"""
st_013420_0124#0,"""It looks like the rumored ARKS Information Sisters are trying their best as well!"""
st_013420_0126#0,"""Who?"""
st_013420_0140#0,"""But still everyone is about even, so from here on everyone still has a fair shot!"""
st_013420_0150#0,"""Hey Huey? Is reading this dribble supposed to be fun?"""
st_013420_0160#0,"""The first half has concluded, everyone keep up the effort!"""
st_013420_0170#0,"""Claris Claes, to grow up you have to do things you normally wouldn't do if you had the choice."""
st_013420_0175#0,"""So at least read up on the event, okay?"""
st_013420_0180#0,"""It's nice to know that we're in the lead, but we need to stay focused."""
st_013420_0190#0,"""Also, do you have the same bad feeling I do, like something is going to happen?"""
