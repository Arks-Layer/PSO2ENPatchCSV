ra_013030_0010#0,"""Hm? About the past? You want to hear about when Dark Falz first appeared?"""
ra_013030_0020#0,"""I can tell you a little from what I learned about it in class."""
ra_013030_0030#0,"""But I'm not very good at studying."""
ra_013030_0040#0,"""So I can't guarantee it's completely accurate, but if that's okay then..."""
ra_013030_0050#0,"""From what I can remember Dark Falz's name popped up twice."""
ra_013030_0060#0,"""The war forty years ago and that incident from ten years ago."""
ra_013030_0070#0,"""The battle forty years ago was when Dark Falz Elder was defeated."""
ra_013030_0080#0,"""It looks like in retrospect, he wasn't defeated, only sealed."""
ra_013030_0090#0,"""The three members who defeated him became the Three Hero's."""
ra_013030_0100#0,"""Those three members collected the remaining ARKS and rebuilt the organization."""
ra_013030_0110#0,"""That, and then ten years ago... I remember it personally..."""
ra_013030_0120#0,"""When Darks Falz went on a large-scale offensive against ARKS."""
ra_013030_0130#0,"""If I remember correctly, the second generation Claris Claes was able to fend him off."""
ra_013030_0140#0,"""But she died in the battle, which is why the current Claris Claes is the third."""
ra_013030_0150#0,"""There were a lot of deaths in the top of ARKS. It really was a tragedy."""
ra_013030_0160#0,"""There's not telling just how many ships were destroyed in that attack."""
ra_013030_0170#0,"""It wasn't just ARKS; there was a large number of civilian casualties too."""
ra_013030_0180#0,"""My older sister disappeared in that attack as well."""
ra_013030_0190#0,"""Sorry, it looks like I got side tracked!"""
ra_013030_0200#0,"""Anyways, that's about the jist of it. Sorry if there are any holes in what I said."""
ra_013030_0210#0,"""Compared to past events, it seems this encounter with Dark Falz didn't go too badly at all."""
ra_013030_0220#0,"""People we knew were lost..."""
ra_013030_0230#0,"""Well, Zeno hasn't exactly been confirmed dead though."""
ra_013030_0240#0,"""That's right. He only disappeared. We need to hope for the best!"""
