un_010680_0030#0,"""Ah, hi, I'm Tea."""
un_010680_0040#0,"""Today, let's see! Why don't I teach you about photon manipulation?"""
un_010680_0050#0,"""Sorry, it seems she heard this from someone else and wants to tell someone."""
un_010680_0060#0,"""It turns out, photons are all around us in the air, and inside our bodies too!"""
