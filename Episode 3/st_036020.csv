st_036020_0010#0,"""Kaka... I had thought that the Kuron military wasn't a match for me, but it seems they have some backbone."""
st_036020_0020#0,"""Furthermore, they're using skills I find distasteful... Really, they're quite infuriating opponents."""
st_036020_0030#0,"""I know they're not genuine, but if I think that they were once children of this star, things get difficult..."""
st_036020_0040#0,"""No, it's not difficult... This familiar sadness is what I felt that time when I died and was reborn."""
st_036020_0050#0,"""That time when all of the Kuronians and Shironians cast mother and father aside. Nostalgic."""
st_036020_0060#0,"""Well, whatever the scenario, that time was worse. That time when everything became an enemy."""
st_036020_0070#0,"""<%me>...! And Matoi! You idiots, why did you come?!"""
st_036020_0080#0,"""That's our line, idiot! We came to save our friend!"""
st_036020_0090#0,"""You... idiots! Your bodies are close to their limits! Any more and...!"""
st_036020_0100#0,"""1. That's also our line."""
st_036020_0110#0,"""2. Who is near their limit?"""
st_036020_0120#0,"""It's just as <%me> said. Sukunahime should be feeling exhaustion at levels that aren't human anymore."""
st_036020_0130#0,"""I know we arrived fashionably late, but should you just be standing around looking confused?"""
st_036020_0140#0,"""You've gotten quite talkative since I last saw you, Matoi."""
st_036020_0150#0,"""Wha...! An... Ash transfer!"""
st_036020_0160#0,"""We somehow managed to meet up."""
st_036020_0170#0,"""Kotoshiro... Why are you here...?"""
st_036020_0180#0,"""A secret art of the White King. As you said before, the coward's spells certainly are reliable."""
st_036020_0190#0,"""I know! I taught him that. I want to hear why you're here!"""
st_036020_0200#0,"""I arrived to save you, mother."""
st_036020_0210#0,"""Ch...! This guy...! To call me that at this place and time...!"""
st_036020_0220#0,"""Mother, a message from the White King. [We Shironians are weak, but will stand by the Miko.]"""
st_036020_0230#0,"""That stupid king... I see, the presences outside are those foolish Shironians."""
st_036020_0240#0,"""Yes. We're sending troops in. We'll hold the line here."""
st_036020_0250#0,"""Then, everything will be over once we defeat [Double] all the way in the back."""

st_036020_0270#0,"""Wh- what are you saying, Matoi?! I'll go as well!"""
st_036020_0280#0,"""With you that exhausted... To be frank, you'll just be in the way."""
st_036020_0290#0,"""Guh... That's harsh...! I'll be angry if you leave me, you...!"""
st_036020_0300#0,"""That might be true, but that's not the main reason."""
st_036020_0310#0,"""[Double] is something the ARKS... is something <%me> and I must defeat ourselves."""
st_036020_0320#0,"""Whatever, do as you like! However, I will not allow you two to die! You two, come back alive! Got it?"""
st_036020_0330#0,"""Let's go, <%me>. It's our duty as ARKS to defeat [Double]."""
