text01#0,"""Nice to meet you! My name is Ash. Actually, we're in a bit of trouble..."""
text02#0,"""O-oh, I'm sorry... I haven't introduced you yet. This is Master..."""
text03#0,"""...Kireek. And I'm nobody's Master."""
text04#0,"""Sorry, it's just everyone said...<br>...Anyway, Kireek and I are members of the Hunter's Guild on Pioneer II."""
text05#0,"""We were exploring the Forest area of planet Ragol, when we suddenly heard a strange fanfare..."""
text06#0,"""A mysterious rainbow-colored device that looked like a teleporter had appeared right in front of us."""
text07#0,"""I wondered what it was, so I went to check it out, then it activated...<br>Before I realised what had happened, I was here."""
text08#0,"""I think I've bitten off more than I can chew here...<br>The technology, culture and people here are very different from those of Ragol and Pioneer II."""
text09#0,"""I feel like I've stepped into a whole new world or something. Please! You have to help us get back home!"""
text01#1,"""Ever since I got here, my body's felt lighter. Is the gravity different here?"""
text02#1,"""I never even considered it back on Ragol, but I might be able to jump around in battle here!"""
text01#2,"""You know, when I was exploring on Ragol, I kept finding Message Packs that gave me advice about things like enemies and dangerous terrain."""
text02#2,"""It's a really great way to pass on information to Hunters who follow after you. I want to share this idea with as many people as I can!"""
text03#1,"""...Oh, do you have Message Packs here too...? Huh?! You can even read them while walking? You mean, you can read them without enemies catching up and hitting you?!"""
text01#3,"""Oh yeah, I forgot to explain earlier...<br>Pioneer II is the name of an enormous interstellar colony ship."""
text02#3,"""It serves as our base of operations from its position in orbit over planet Ragol. A lot of people still live on board it."""
text03#2,"""10 years ago, Pioneer I landed on Ragol and began conducting a preliminary survey, preparing it for our arrival..."""
text04#1,"""But just before Pioneer II arrived, there was a massive explosion on the planet's surface...<br>That's what we were investigating."""
text05#1,"""Principal Tyrell personally asked me to join the investigation, so I was really hoping to get some results soon...<br>All this is so frustrating."""
text01#4,"""Coming here has been a really valuable experience for me. I seriously can't thank you enough for your help."""
text02#4,"""The man I want to become is someone who other people can trust to watch their back.<br>...But I'm not there yet."""
text03#3,"""Someday, if I hear that fanfare again, I'll come back to protect your back. I'm sure I'll be stronger by then!"""
