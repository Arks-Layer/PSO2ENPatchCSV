text01002#0,"""This is my favorite swimsuit. How do I look? I've been working hard on staying in shape!"""
11_voice_NPC_5589_204#0,"""By the way... We've been given some time off, so we thought we'd spend it on planet Wopal. Right, Annette?"""
text01004#0,"""Correct. That is why I'm also wearing my swimsuit. When Gene gets an idea in her head, there's never any time to argue..."""
11_voice_NPC_5591_102#0,"""Wait a minute! Aren't you forgetting about someone? Your Beach Queen walks among you! Bluesy Requiem is here too!"""
text01006#0,"""That's right... Bluesy Requiem is on vacation with us, too..."""
text01007#0,"""What?! Where has this hostility come from? Oh, Gene... And after I offered to teach you my guaranteed trick to make boys swoon, too~."""
11_voice_NPC_5590_201#0,"""Heh... I feel like I've heard that somewhere before. Still, it is reassuring to have Bluesy Requiem with us."""

text03001#0,"""Watermelon splitting, beach volleyball,<br>diving, surfing..."""
11_voice_NPC_5589_204#2,"""What should I do next? I just can't choose!"""
11_voice_NPC_5589_201#0,"""Seraphy used to join us at the beach house, but not this time."""
text04002#0,"""I was just thinking about the beach house's ramen... What is it that makes it so delicious?<br>Mmm, ramen... Now I'm hungry..."""
