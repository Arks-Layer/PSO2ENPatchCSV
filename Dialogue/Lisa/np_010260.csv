11_voice_NPC_5026_100#3,"""All sorts of enemies have weak points, yes? If you drive all your attacks into an enemy's weak point, they stop breathing really quickly."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_106#1,"""Anyone who'd talk to Lisa would have to be absolutely out of their mind. So... That means you're quite weird."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#4,"""Not too long ago, Lisa was very different. She was actually quite a shy girl, you know."""
Risa_04_020#0,"""What happened, you may ask? ...Well, every young lady has her secrets. Hehe. Hehehe."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_104#0,"""Lisa doesn't want to die or anything, but she has often thought about what it would be like, you know?"""

11_voice_NPC_5026_105#0,"""Does Lisa look like she lives all that recklessly? Lisa just does what she thinks is fun."""

11_voice_NPC_5026_105#1,"""There's still hardly any information about Darkers but for some reason when ARKS captures them, they don't examine them."""
Risa_09_020#0,"""Maybe they're afraid to? Or maybe... they don't need to? Either way, it's quite the mystery."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#5,"""There are times when Lisa loses her way, you know. But, it's times like those when she does what she wants to do most."""
Risa_10_020#0,"""Lisa doesn't have to worry about anything at all, you know? She can just go and kill."""
Alice_01_10#0,"""When did Lisa take a liking to Ranger, you ask? That's a strange question, you know?"""
Alice_01_20#0,"""It's not a very interesting story, but since it's you who's asking, Lisa will tell you all about it!"""
Alice_01_30#0,"""It was when Lisa was a little girl. Pure, innocent Lisa was playing with her toy guns as she usually did, you know?"""
Alice_01_40#0,"""But then! Something came out of one of the guns for some reason, even though it was just a toy! That's when Lisa... stopped playing pretend."""
Alice_01_50#0,"""You see, Rangers have an innate ability to fire their Photon energy out like bullets, you know? And so, that's how Lisa went on a shooting spree with just a toy gun."""
Alice_01_60#0,"""What happened to the people Lisa shot? Hehe. Why would Lisa know something like that?"""
Alice_01_70#0,"""Lisa just remembers that it gave her a REALLY nice feeling, you know?"""

Risa_mb12_020#0,"""For some reason Lisa feels a bit guilty about destroying everything. Doesn't stop her, though."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_104#2,"""Those dragon altars are a bit tricky for Lisa, you know?"""
Risa_mb13_020#0,"""When Lisa shoots everything with reckless abandon, they only really get angry when their valuables are destroyed."""
Risa_mb13_030#0,"""But they don't get nearly as frothing with rage if everything else is destroyed, so it's kind of boring, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_101#3,"""Something about planet Lillipa is different recently, you know?"""
Risa_mb14_020#0,"""Both ARKS and Darkers have become a lot more active there. Hehehe. Lisa's getting kind of excited about it."""
Risa_mb14_030#0,"""Who knows what will happen? Whatever it is, Lisa looks forward to it."""

Risa_mb15_020#0,"""Lisa can't explain why, but she has a very bad feeling about that place. It's quite upsetting, you know?"""
Risa_mb15_030#0,"""Lisa actually tries to be careful when she's there! Are you impressed? You should be proud of her!"""
Risa_mb16_010#0,"""Something big is about to happen. Lisa can feel it in her circuits!"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_101#4,"""Lisa's not sure what it is, but she definitely knows when a storm is brewing. Hehehehe."""
Risa_mb16_030#0,"""Lisa likes it when she can cut loose. When she can shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot all sorts of things."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_106#2,"""Oh? Oh? Oh my, my! It's good to see you're alright, you know? What a comeback you made!"""
Risa_mb16zeno_020#0,"""Fighting with you was really, really inspiring, you know? Lisa would like to do that again sometime."""
Risa_mb16zeno_030#0,"""Lisa and friends have been pretty busy around here, you know?"""
Risa_mb18_010#0,"""Planet Harkotan, was it? Hmm... Oh, that one. Lisa really likes it there, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#7,"""Mainly because of all the big enemies. Lisa likes going in guns blazing."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_104#3,"""The culture and civilization? What's that? Can Lisa shoot it?!"""
Risa_mb19_010#0,"""The Floating Facility of Wopal? Lisa doesn't go there. It's kind of boring."""
Risa_mb19_020#0,"""The archaeologists would give Lisa a hard time if she just went around shooting the place up, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#8,"""Lisa would much rather go to a place where she could light the area up without worrying about it, you know? Hehe. Hehehehe."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#9,"""That right there is what's really been on Lisa's mind. So, what about you?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_101#5,"""撃っても撃っても撃っても<br>まだまだ撃てていない場所があって<br>とてもとても満足ですよお。"""
Risa_mb21_010#0,"""Lisa thinks the Corrupted Areas are way more interesting than Dark Falz."""
Risa_mb21_020#0,"""They are areas with REALLY strong enemies; perfect places to unload your entire arsenal and then some, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#10,"""Hehe. Sounds fun, right? Lisa's just happy she has a place where she can shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#11,"""[Double]... [Apprentice]... The problems just keep piling up, you know?"""
Risa_mb22_020#0,"""Well, it's a Darker, so Lisa will just enjoy shooting it LOTS and LOTS of times, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_101#6,"""Lisa is happiest when she is raining absolute hell down her enemies, you know?"""
Risa_mb23_010#0,"""Oh, hello hello! That was pretty intense, you know? It's good you weren't hurt too bad."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#12,"""Well actually, if you ask Lisa, being eaten by Dark Falz is kind of an honour, you know?"""
Risa_mb23_030#0,"""Because it means you must have killed lots and lots of enemies. Lisa's actually kind of jealous, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_107#0,"""Oh my my my my! Lisa heard what happened! It's a good thing you're okay, you know?"""
Risa_mb23_after_020#0,"""Well now, things have gotten pretty hectic, but I wonder what will happen, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#13,"""Oh, Lisa was trying to sleep. Say... If Lisa can't sleep, can she put something else to sleep? You know. Permanently."""
Risa_mb24_010#0,"""Well well well well now! This is gonna be a big fight. Hehehe. It's exciting, you know?"""
Risa_mb24_020#0,"""So many enemies... Lisa's going full tilt for this, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#14,"""Hehehe. Hehe. Lisa can hardly wait anymore. She really wants to shoot some enemies, you know?"""
Risa_mb24_after_010#0,"""Oh, oh my my my! Hello hello! Good to see you aren't dead."""
Risa_mb24_after_020#0,"""Lisa couldn't have expected anything else. Lisa's really quite happy. She had lots of fun, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#15,"""It's been a while since Lisa mercilessly slaughtered that many enemies. That was really fun, you know?"""
Risa_mb25_010#0,"""Lisa heard there's been changes in administration, but Lisa doesn't care about that stuff."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#16,"""Lisa's way more interested in finding ways to destroy enemies, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_107#1,"""Oh? Oh my my! How strange... Shouldn't the person in front of Lisa be sleeping right now?"""
st01_020#0,"""Oh, but but but... what a beautiful way of sleeping, you know?"""
st01_030#0,"""So how was it? Cold Sleep, that is. Lisa thinks it must have gone by in a split second."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_106#3,"""My my, Lisa is so very jealous! You've gotten mixed up in something quite spectacular, you know?"""
st01_020#1,"""Please let Lisa in on that! There's probably lots of things to shoot and shoot and shoot and KILL, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#17,"""Oh. Where would Lisa be stationed? Hehehe. Lisa probably shouldn't even bother asking, should she?"""
st01_020#2,"""What Lisa's REALLY interested in is that group that came from Earth! Lisa wants to try shooting them. Hehehe."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#18,"""Lisa wonders what it would feel like to shoot them, you know? Hehehehe. That's what's been on Lisa's mind."""
st01_020#3,"""Oh, don't look at Lisa like that! It's okay! Lisa only shoots when authorized."""
st01_030#1,"""But! If Lisa WAS authorized, she'd definitely want to try shooting them. It would probably feel wonderful!"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#19,"""Lisa's actually found explosives to be quite wonderful lately, you know?"""
st01_020#4,"""Of course, nothing tops driving bullets into skulls, but there's something quite charming about deconstructing someone on a molecular level."""
st01_030#2,"""Oh yes, Lisa's definitely wants to try it. If you find anyone who looks like they'd blow up nicely, please do give Lisa a call!"""
st01_010#0,"""Anyone who treats ARKS with hostility must be met with hostility in kind. That's what Lisa thinks!"""
st01_020#5,"""When one side thinks that they are right and everyone else is wrong, the fight's already begun. No point in holding back, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#20,"""That's when Lisa starts thinking about who would feel the best to shoot. Hehe. Hehehehe."""
st01_010#1,"""Lisa was on the Ship when it was attacked, but she wasn't allowed to go to where all the fighting was."""
st01_020#6,"""The enemies were right here, you know?! It was the perfect time for a fight! What a letdown."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#21,"""Who cares if the martial law limiters weren't released? If Lisa can't shoot her guns, then she'll just start punching! Hehehehe."""
st01_010#2,"""Hmm. Hmm! So... Phantoms are a new species that took on the form of Darkers?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_106#4,"""While that sounds like it'd be hard to tell which is Darker and which is Phantom, it's actually quite easy."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#22,"""You can tell by shooting them! Each one feels different to shoot at, you know? Hehehe."""
st01_010#3,"""Evolution is quite interesting. But how exactly does evolution take place, you know?"""
st01_020#7,"""Is it based on what one wants? Or maybe what one doesn't want? That's just selfish, you know?"""
st01_030#3,"""Lisa's thinking too much. Lisa likes doing fun things instead of thinking about confusing things."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#23,"""What does Lisa do for fun, you ask? You should know that by now, you know? Hehe. Hehehehe."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_104#4,"""Hmmm. Hmmmm... Ah, it's you. How are things?"""
sq00_020#0,"""Oh, Lisa's just worried about something. Don't worry, it doesn't have anything to do with you."""
sq00_030#0,"""Anyways, are you all ready? Keep in mind that normal tactics won't work on these guys. Think outside the box. """
sq01_010#0,"""Nobody has to tell Lisa anything for her to know that this has become quite an odd situation."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_104#5,"""If there are no Darkers left... What will Lisa shoot then? How conflicting, you know?"""
sq02_020#0,"""You wouldn't happen to know of anything that might soon deserve to be shot, would you?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_107#2,"""Hmm? HMMM? Oh my my my! You're on your way to go kill something, aren't you?"""
sq04_020#0,"""Lisa can tell, you know? You have a peculiar look about you."""
sq04_030#0,"""So what are you doing? Is it going to be really dangerous?"""
sq04_040#0,"""Well, it probably has nothing to do with Lisa. Hmmm. Or... perhaps it does, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_106#5,"""……おやおや、あらあら？<br>なんだか雰囲気、変わってますねえ。<br>すごくすごくピリピリした感じです。"""
