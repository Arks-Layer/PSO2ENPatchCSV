Emilia_01_10#0,"""おっ、どうしたんじゃ？<br>折り入って話があると？"""
Emilia_01_20#0,"""ふむ……素材加工の協力、か。<br>武具でないものを鍛えるのは<br>不慣れではあるが……"""
Emilia_01_30#0,"""他ならない、お主の依頼ならば<br>断るわけにはいかんの。<br>微力ながら、全力を尽くそう。"""
Paty_01_10#0,"""なんじゃ？<br>サンタクロースじゃと？"""
Paty_01_20#0,"""……名を聞いたことはあるが<br>どういった生業の者かは<br>詳しくないのう。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#0,"""ほう、赤い服をまとい<br>空飛ぶソリに乗る……とな？<br>ふぅむ……"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_106#0,"""……ぬぬぬっ！？<br>何やらインスピレーションが<br>わいてきたぞ！"""
Paty_01_50#0,"""このアイディアを今すぐ形にしたい。<br>お主の訊ね事は調べておくので<br>すまんが、また今度にしてくれぬか。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#1,"""...Oh? This is unexpected. While I was making weapons, were you making girls who fight in Halloween costumes?"""
sierra_020#0,"""I'm not sure why you're asking me about this. All I create is weapons. Well, if they have something in common..."""
sierra_030#0,"""Those that combine a beautiful appearance with superior abilities, they are jewels among jewels.<br>...Or so it's said."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#0,"""Hmm, weapons that look like women and can fight by themselves... I haven't felt inspiration like this in a long time! Hohohoho, you have my gratitude!"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_105#0,"""Sigh. It's no use. I can't think of anything. I guess my crafting days are over."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#2,"""Ten years ago it was a different story. I felt so alive in the face of crisis. It's not pleasant getting old."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#0,"""Do you think it's strange that I find inspiration in a simple object? Ha ha, you may be right."""
Jig_03_020#0,"""But you know that thrill you feel when you face a formidable foe? That's how I feel about weaponry."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#1,"""Repairs have never been my expertise, but it turns out to have its appeal. Perhaps I should say I like the challenge."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#1,"""You want to know about the weapons I've made in the past? There are too many to count, although I have no idea how many are still out there."""
Jig_05_020#0,"""I'm a craftsman, you see. Once I finish a piece, I move on to the next one. That's just how it is."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_105#1,"""If it wasn't for that war 10 years ago, I might still have fire in my belly."""
Jig_06_020#0,"""So many competent weapon wielders lost their lives in that conflict. That fight had terrible consequences."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_108#0,"""I don't know the story behind the war that was fought 10 years ago. I don't even think any ARKS members know much."""
Jig_07_020#0,"""That's partly because it's classified, but I think the main reason is people just don't want to remember."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_105#2,"""The profession of weaponsmith has always been a highly-valued one around here. I've never been quite sure what to think of that."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#2,"""Leave that weapon to me! On my honor as a craftsman, I'll fix it up good as new!"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_107#0,"""There's a nasty feeling in the air. It's so bad that even I can feel it. What's going on around here...?"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#3,"""No sense crying over spilled milk. I'll make you a weapon that's just as powerful as that other one! Just you wait and see!"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#4,"""If you're going up against Dark Falz, you'll need even more powerful weapons!"""
Jig_mb9_020#0,"""Looks like I got my inspiration back just in time to put it to use. Lucky coincidence, that."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#5,"""I might not be able to make another Genesis Weapon, but I can make the next best thing! You have my word on that!"""
Jig_mb10_020#0,"""...But what's my word worth when I don't have the raw materials to back it up? This is mighty frustrating..."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_105#3,"""That Rod I repaired for you wasn't a normal weapon."""
Jig_mb11_020#0,"""Whoever made it didn't consider the effect it would have on its wielder. It drains its user's Photons in seconds."""
Jig_mb11_030#0,"""What in the world was its creator thinking...?<br>I just don't understand it..."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#2,"""A strong weapon doesn't make a strong wielder. Both have to be strong, or neither will be."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#3,"""Hmm, I've got a bad feeling about something. Oh, don't worry, I'm not saying we're about to get attacked or anything like that."""
Jig_mb13_020#0,"""It just feels like a difficult job is about to come my way. Call it craftsman's intuition."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#4,"""Looks like my bad feeling was on the mark. I stick my head over the battlements after a long time away, and what do I get for it but the job from hell dropped right in my lap!"""
Jig_mb14_020#0,"""...Still, someone's counting on me, so I have no choice but to live up to my reputation!"""
Jig_mb15_010#0,"""Looks like my bad feeling was on the mark. I stick my head over the battlements after a long time away, and what do I get for it but the job from hell dropped right in my lap!"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#3,"""...Still, someone's counting on me, so I have no choice but to live up to my reputation!"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#4,"""We live in an age when powerful weapons are what's called for. War is on the horizon, mark my words."""
Jig_mb16_020#0,"""The times I'm at my busiest are always the worst times for everyone else. It's a sad situation, but it's the one we've got to live with."""
Jig_mb16zeno_010#0,"""Ah, I'm glad you're safe! That announcement Regius made had me doubting my own ears for a moment!"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#6,"""Still, everyone's come back to their senses now. Guess we owe that to you. Much appreciated."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#5,"""新しいアークスとして<br>皆が未来へ歩み始めているな。<br>良きかな、良きかな。"""
Jig_mb18_020#0,"""わしもその変化に取り残されんよう<br>より一層頑張らねばならんな。"""
Jig_mb20_010#0,"""技術を独占しても意味がない。<br>次代に伝えていかなければ<br>そこで廃れてしまう。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#5,"""わしだけではなく、技術者にとって<br>後継者、というのは頭痛の種じゃよ。<br>簡単に見つかるものでもないからの。"""
Jig_mb22_010#0,"""誠心誠意、魂を込めて作品を作る。<br>それが職人というものじゃ。"""
Jig_mb22_020#0,"""自分が培ってきた技術をもってして<br>作品を作るんじゃ。<br>なかなかどうして、やり甲斐はある。"""
Jig_mb22_030#0,"""今もこれからも。<br>その気持で、わしは作品を<br>作っていくつもりじゃぞ。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#6,"""おお、お主か……！<br>顔を見ると安心するのう。<br>無事でよかった。"""
Jig_mb23_after_020#0,"""痛ましいことになってしまったが……<br>お主のことじゃ、もうどうするのかは<br>決めておるんじゃろう。"""
Jig_mb23_after_030#0,"""わしは、なにも心配しておらんぞ。<br>じゃが、無理はせんようにな。"""
Jig_mb24_after_010#0,"""お主ならやり遂げられると思ったが<br>やっぱり心配でな……<br>気になっていたんじゃ。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#7,"""こうして顔も見れたし一安心じゃ。<br>じゃが、しばらくは無理せんようにな。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#7,"""おお、おお！<br>お主は……そうか、復帰したのか！"""
st01_020#0,"""レギアスから度々連絡は受けていたが<br>……こうして面と向かって会うと<br>やはり、違うの。"""
st01_030#0,"""とはいえ病み上がりみたいなものじゃ。<br>あまり無理はせんようにの。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#6,"""あのマトイという子の<br>クラリッサのように、専用のものを<br>用意してやりたいものなんじゃが……"""
st01_020#1,"""お主はフォトンの傾向が自由すぎて<br>専用の武装を定めにくくてのう。<br>万能というのも、考えものじゃな。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#7,"""お主向けの武器というのも<br>色々考えてみたんじゃが……<br>どうも思い浮かばなくてのう。"""
st01_020#2,"""ずっと共に戦場を駆けられる<br>相棒のような存在を<br>与えてやりたいんじゃがなあ……"""
st01_010#0,"""お主向けの武器というのも<br>色々考えてみたんじゃが……<br>どうも思い浮かばなくてのう。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#8,"""かの地球とやらで話題になっている<br>具現武装、あれはいいヒントに<br>なりそうなものなんじゃが……"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#9,"""先の襲撃時に、具現武装とやらを<br>この目で見られていれば<br>再現も可能だったかもしれんが……"""
st01_020#3,"""避難誘導を無視するわけにもいかず<br>……無念だが、仕方がないのう。"""
st01_010#1,"""具現武装とやらについて、情報提供<br>およびアースガイドという面々の<br>協力で、実物を拝見した。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#10,"""……したのだが、再現は無理じゃな。<br>あれは個々の能力に拠りすぎていて<br>汎用化には持っていきにくい。"""
st01_030#1,"""イメージしやすいもので、簡易的に<br>具現化した共有武装などは参考に<br>なったが……普通の武器になるのう。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#8,"""There's nothing I can say to you that would help. You've been preparing for this a long time, haven't you?"""
sq00_020#0,"""Go out and do your best. That's all there is to it."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#9,"""Hmm, so you're back. Outstanding."""
sq01_020#0,"""I've seen far too many head off to a decisive battle and never return. Just making it back here is good enough for me."""
sq13_010#0,"""So someone who even Regius's Tsukuriyo couldn't touch has appeared...<br>I can feel the old fire burning in me again."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#8,"""If the weapons we have don't work, then I'll just have to create one that will! Heheheh, just you watch me!"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_109#0,"""So someone who even Regius's Tsukuriyo couldn't touch has appeared...<br>I can feel the old fire burning in me again."""
ep6_sq00_02#0,"""If the weapons we have don't work, then I'll just have to create one that will! Heheheh, just you watch me!"""
ep6_sq01_01#0,"""I've heard all about it from Maria and Regius. If Photons don't work on them, we could be in trouble..."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_105#4,"""A lot of damaged weapons have come in from that last battle, so I'll be busy repairing them for a while."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#9,"""I've heard about your success. We were in a tight spot, but you've steered us to safer waters!"""
ep6_sq02_02#0,"""Just be careful not to overwork yourself. If you need any weapons repaired, you know who to call."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_102#0,"""We're getting a bit closer to competitive, but they didn't waste any time showing off that overwhelming power gap."""
ep6_sq02_01_02#0,"""Still, as long as I can see that determination in your eyes, I'll devote all my efforts to realizing it."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#10,"""Hmm... Have they lost their momentum? Whatever you did, seems like it's made a difference."""
ep6_sq05_2#0,"""Still, no sense underestimating them. If there's anything I can do to help out, let me know. I'm here for you."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#11,"""Aha, you came back, then? You did an excellent job defeating Shiva. This old weaponsmith salutes you!"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_105#5,"""Anyway, getting everything fixed up is going to be hard work. Repair orders are coming in by the dozen..."""
text03#0,"""I'm running on fumes here, but those Genesis Weapons need fixing. No rest for the wicked!"""
