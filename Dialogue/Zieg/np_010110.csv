Emilia_01_20#0,"""ふむ……素材加工の協力、か。<br>武具でないものを鍛えるのは<br>不慣れではあるが……"""
Emilia_01_30#0,"""他ならない、お主の依頼ならば<br>断るわけにはいかんの。<br>微力ながら、全力を尽くそう。"""
Paty_01_10#0,"""なんじゃ？<br>サンタクロースじゃと？"""
Paty_01_20#0,"""……名を聞いたことはあるが<br>どういった生業の者かは<br>詳しくないのう。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#0,"""ほう、赤い服をまとい<br>空飛ぶソリに乗る……とな？<br>ふぅむ……"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_106#0,"""……ぬぬぬっ！？<br>何やらインスピレーションが<br>わいてきたぞ！"""
Paty_01_50#0,"""このアイディアを今すぐ形にしたい。<br>お主の訊ね事は調べておくので<br>すまんが、また今度にしてくれぬか。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#1,"""...Oh? This is unexpected. While I was making weapons, were you making girls who fight in Halloween costumes?"""
sierra_020#0,"""I'm not sure why you're asking me about this. All I create is weapons. Well, if they have something in common..."""
sierra_030#0,"""Those that combine a beautiful appearance with superior abilities, they are jewels among jewels.<br>...Or so it's said."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#0,"""Hmm, weapons that look like women and can fight by themselves... I haven't felt inspiration like this in a long time! Hohohoho, you have my gratitude!"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_105#0,"""Sigh. It's no use. I can't think of anything. I guess my crafting days are over."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#2,"""Ten years ago it was a different story. I felt so alive in the face of crisis. It's not pleasant getting old."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#0,"""Do you think it's strange that I find inspiration in a simple object? Ha ha, you may be right."""
Jig_03_020#0,"""But you know that thrill you feel when you face a formidable foe? That's how I feel about weaponry."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#1,"""Repairs have never been my expertise, but it turns out to have its appeal. Perhaps I should say I like the challenge."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#1,"""You want to know about the weapons I've made in the past? There are too many to count, although I have no idea how many are still out there."""
Jig_05_020#0,"""I'm a craftsman, you see. Once I finish a piece, I move on to the next one. That's just how it is."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_105#1,"""If it wasn't for that war 10 years ago, I might still have fire in my belly."""
Jig_06_020#0,"""So many competent weapon wielders lost their lives in that conflict. That fight had terrible consequences."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_108#0,"""I don't know the story behind the war that was fought 10 years ago. I don't even think any ARKS members know much."""
Jig_07_020#0,"""That's partly because it's classified, but I think the main reason is people just don't want to remember."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_105#2,"""I'm not sure whether to be delighted or resentful that a maker of war weapons such as myself is valued so much here. It's difficult."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#2,"""Leave that weapon to me! On my honor as a craftsman, I'll fix it as good as new!"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_107#0,"""I sense this bad feeling so explicit, even I can feel it. What is about to happen..."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#3,"""It's no use dwelling on the past. I shall create a new weapon equally as powerful than that one!"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#4,"""ダークファルスと対峙すると<br>いうのであれば、なおさらもっと<br>強い武器が必要じゃろう！"""
Jig_mb9_020#0,"""But how ironic that my opportunity to make use of my inspiration would come so early."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#5,"""創世器とまではいかずとも<br>それに酷似したものなら作れる。<br>わしにはその自信がある！"""
Jig_mb10_020#0,"""...however without the proper raw materials, it is only a hollow confidence. That's so irritating..."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_105#3,"""わしの修復したあの巨大な杖。<br>あれは、尋常ではなかったな。"""
Jig_mb11_020#0,"""It was made without considering its effect on the person who would use it. Such that it sucks up all of the users' Photons."""
Jig_mb11_030#0,"""The person who made it in the first place, what on earth were they thinking... I struggle to understand."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#2,"""A powerful weapon doesn't make a powerful wielder. Power is not a one-way road."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#3,"""Hmm... I've got a bad feeling about this. Ah, no. It's not the kind of premonition that might imply we're going to be attacked or anything."""
Jig_mb13_020#0,"""It's just a craftsman's intuition. Like I feel like someone is going to make an impossible order."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#4,"""These bad feelings do end up being true. I thought I'd just show my face since it's been a while, and I get a spectacular present instead."""
Jig_mb14_020#0,"""...but now that I'm relied upon, I must live up to expectations!"""
Jig_mb15_010#0,"""These bad feelings do end up being true. I thought I'd just show my face since it's been a while, and I get a spectacular present instead."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#3,"""...but now that I'm relied upon, I must live up to expectations!"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#4,"""When the sign of the times desire powerful weaponry, it means that it is side-by-side with warfare."""
Jig_mb16_020#0,"""For me to be busy is a sign that it's not a great era to be in. It's sad, but true."""
Jig_mb16zeno_010#0,"""Well well, glad to see you are safe! When I heard Regius' communication I even doubted my own ears!"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_101#6,"""However, thanks to you everyone has opened their eyes. This situation is to your credit. Well done, and thanks."""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#5,"""新しいアークスとして<br>皆が未来へ歩み始めているな。<br>良きかな、良きかな。"""
Jig_mb18_020#0,"""わしもその変化に取り残されんよう<br>より一層頑張らねばならんな。"""
Jig_mb20_010#0,"""技術を独占しても意味がない。<br>次代に伝えていかなければ<br>そこで廃れてしまう。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#5,"""わしだけではなく、技術者にとって<br>後継者、というのは頭痛の種じゃよ。<br>簡単に見つかるものでもないからの。"""
Jig_mb22_010#0,"""誠心誠意、魂を込めて作品を作る。<br>それが職人というものじゃ。"""
Jig_mb22_020#0,"""自分が培ってきた技術をもってして<br>作品を作るんじゃ。<br>なかなかどうして、やり甲斐はある。"""
Jig_mb22_030#0,"""今もこれからも。<br>その気持で、わしは作品を<br>作っていくつもりじゃぞ。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#6,"""おお、お主か……！<br>顔を見ると安心するのう。<br>無事でよかった。"""
Jig_mb23_after_020#0,"""痛ましいことになってしまったが……<br>お主のことじゃ、もうどうするのかは<br>決めておるんじゃろう。"""
Jig_mb23_after_030#0,"""わしは、なにも心配しておらんぞ。<br>じゃが、無理はせんようにな。"""
Jig_mb24_after_010#0,"""お主ならやり遂げられると思ったが<br>やっぱり心配でな……<br>気になっていたんじゃ。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#7,"""こうして顔も見れたし一安心じゃ。<br>じゃが、しばらくは無理せんようにな。"""

st01_020#0,"""レギアスから度々連絡は受けていたが<br>……こうして面と向かって会うと<br>やはり、違うの。"""
st01_030#0,"""とはいえ病み上がりみたいなものじゃ。<br>あまり無理はせんようにの。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#6,"""あのマトイという子の<br>クラリッサのように、専用のものを<br>用意してやりたいものなんじゃが……"""
st01_020#1,"""お主はフォトンの傾向が自由すぎて<br>専用の武装を定めにくくてのう。<br>万能というのも、考えものじゃな。"""

11_voice_NPC_5011_104#8,"""かの地球とやらで話題になっている<br>具現武装、あれはいいヒントに<br>なりそうなものなんじゃが……"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#9,"""先の襲撃時に、具現武装とやらを<br>この目で見られていれば<br>再現も可能だったかもしれんが……"""
st01_020#3,"""避難誘導を無視するわけにもいかず<br>……無念だが、仕方がないのう。"""
st01_010#1,"""具現武装とやらについて、情報提供<br>およびアースガイドという面々の<br>協力で、実物を拝見した。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_104#10,"""……したのだが、再現は無理じゃな。<br>あれは個々の能力に拠りすぎていて<br>汎用化には持っていきにくい。"""
st01_030#1,"""イメージしやすいもので、簡易的に<br>具現化した共有武装などは参考に<br>なったが……普通の武器になるのう。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#8,"""わしから言うことは何もない。<br>心の準備など、とうの昔から<br>しているのであろう？"""
sq00_020#0,"""行って、頑張ってこい。<br>それだけじゃよ。"""
11_voice_NPC_5011_100#9,"""うむ、帰ってきたようじゃの。<br>やはりお主は優秀じゃよ。"""
sq01_020#0,"""決戦へと向かい、帰ってこない者を<br>わしは何人も見てきた。<br>帰ってくるだけで、優秀じゃ。"""
sq13_010#0,"""So someone who even Regius's Tsukuriyo couldn't touch has appeared...<br>I can feel the old fire burning in me again."""
