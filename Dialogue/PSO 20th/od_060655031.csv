text01#0,"""Ahem! I'm Rico. Rico Tyrell, a Hunter...<br>Or perhaps I'd more accurately call myself a scientist?"""
text02#0,"""While investigating Ragol, I happened across a rainbow-colored transfer device. When I inspected it, it sent me here. Sounds like these two came here the same way."""
text03#0,"""Ash has told you what happened to him, hasn't he? I want to compare his data with mine. What can you tell me?"""
text04#0,"""Hmm... I thought so. That explains the discrepancies between Ash's story and mine."""
text05#0,"""To him, the Central Dome has already been completed. That can only mean one thing. Those two came here from further into the future than I did."""
text06#0,"""That means we'll have to be careful when we talk about Ragol. If I learn something I shouldn't, it could wind up changing the future."""
text07#0,"""Wait, what?! Hold on a second! I can't wrap my head around all this! Are we going to be able to get home or not?!"""
text08#0,"""Of course we are. But we'll all need to work together. Yeah... I think the best move would be to recreate that inter-dimensional transfer machine that brought us here in the first place."""
text09#0,"""It seems like inter-dimensional travel will require very high power output. I'll need some reference material... Huh? Planet Earth could be useful here?"""
text10#0,"""...I see, so Earth is also located in another dimension. In that case, could you bring me some material samples from that planet for reference?"""
