text01#0,"""You're back. Thanks for that. I'm just in the middle of replicating the components I need from the data you sent me."""
text02#0,"""I've already tried applying the Ryuker Technique to the prototype Collector Prism. It shone like a rainbow. I call that a successful test!"""
text03#0,"""Hooray! Does that mean we can use it to go home?! Rico... You're a genius! And thank you, too!"""
text04#0,"""I wanted to enjoy slaughtering the creatures of this world a while longer. How unfortunate for me... Heheh..."""
text05#0,"""Recreating the components, fine-tuning them and charging them with the enormous amount of energy we'll need to make the transfer will take some time... We won't be going anywhere for a while."""
text06#0,"""If my adjustments don't work, I might need additional components. I'll let you know if I need anything else."""
text07#0,"""But for now, you have my gratitude for helping set me on the right track to getting us home. Thanks a lot!"""
text01#1,"""Oh, welcome back. I've received the data you sent and recreated the components I needed from it."""
text02#1,"""I hope it works this time...<br>But experimentation is all about trial and improvement. I won't give up, no matter how many failures it takes!"""
text03#1,"""For now, I have to thank you. You've really bailed me out here! I might need your help again soon, so...<br>Thanks in advance!"""
