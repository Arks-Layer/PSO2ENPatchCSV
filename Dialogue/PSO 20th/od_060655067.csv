text02#0,"""To tell you the truth, the main reason I said all that stuff before was so that I didn't have any excuse to run away. Inside, I was scared as anything."""
text03#0,"""You want to thank me for rescuing those people? No, it's you who deserves the thanks. I couldn't have done anything without you."""
text04#0,"""No matter what world we're in, people are people, and rescuing them when they're in trouble is important.<br>...You agree with me, don't you?"""
text05#0,"""Anyway, we'd best be on the alert. There's been reports of fires breaking out all over the place. Let's rest up so we're in good shape for the next one!"""
