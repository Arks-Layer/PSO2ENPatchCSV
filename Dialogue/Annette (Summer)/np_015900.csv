text01002#0,"""It's me, Annette... Though I understand mistaking me for somebody else. There is a reason why I'm dressed like this...<br>You'll have to ask Gene for the details."""
text02001#0,"""The harsh sun on planet Wopal is dangerous. It carries a risk of heatstroke... not to mention being bad for the skin."""

text05003#0,"""Now that things are peaceful... I'm going to spend some time relaxing. I hope you'll make some time for yourself too, Leader."""
