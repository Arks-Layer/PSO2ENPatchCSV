text01003#0,"""Amazing! It's incredible! I'm glad I got permission to come here with Gene and look around!"""
text01004#0,"""Oh, that's right! I think Gene had something she wanted to say. Why don't you talk to her?"""
11_voice_NPC_5567_100#0,"""People in the ARKS ship are really fashionable!"""

text05002#0,"""Whenever I say my name is Akhtar al-Alef, people look at me strangely. Why is that?"""
text05003#0,"""al-Alef... I guess it's rare to have a family name like that here. Everyone here seems to only have one name."""
text05004#0,"""That's right... Gene and Annette are the same."""
11_voice_NPC_5567_100#1,"""I wonder if people can tell that I'm a Darknix... That's a scary thought!"""
11_voice_NPC_5567_110#1,"""Oh, Leader! It's been a long time! Do you remember me? It's Akhtar al-Alef!"""

11_voice_NPC_5567_100#2,"""My sister and I went to Gene's room to hang out the other day!"""
text02#1,"""I guess it's what you'd call a pajama party? Everyone was wearing night clothes. We stayed up all night, just talking about stuff."""
11_voice_NPC_5567_902#1,"""It was super fun...<br>I loved being able to eat sweets so close to midnight. Do you want to come along to our next one, Leader?"""
11_voice_NPC_5567_902#2,"""Hmm, I was thinking of buying a supply package to send to my sister when she's working...<br>What do you think I should put in it, Leader?"""
text02#2,"""Everyone loves sweet things. Maybe something light and creamy? Or maybe something with custard? Chocolate might be good..."""
11_voice_NPC_5567_105#0,"""I dunno. There's so many things I'd want to get, I just can't choose...<br>I'll keep thinking about it."""
