NpcComOnBegin#0,"""Everyone, please defend the <br>energized crystals! Please be <br>aware that crystal power will <br>fade if no ARKS are nearby!"""
NpcComOnSuccess#0,"""/face2 Defense was a success! With <br> the photon activation, PSEs <br>are more likely to occur!"""
NpcComOnFailure#0,"""/face4 Too many energized crystals <br>have been destroyed. Please, <br>return to your mission."""

NpcComOnBegin#1,"""Everybody, protect the crystals to <br>the end. Their power will decay if <br>there's no ARKS around. Be careful."""
NpcComOnSuccess#1,"""OK, that was a success. Photon <br>activation confirmed. The chance of <br>PSEs occurring has shot right up."""
NpcComOnFailure#1,"""Too many crystals were destroyed... <br>Well, there's nothing more we can <br>do. Please, return to your mission."""
NpcComOnDestroy#1,"""Looks like the $(0) energized <br>crystal got broken. Don't let it <br>happen to the other ones."""
NpcComOnLast#1,"""There's only a few <br>energized crystals left. <br>Defend and protect them."""
NpcComOnAddPse#1,"""New energized crystals...<br>Protect them if at all possible.<br>Expect things to look up should <br>you save most of them."""
NpcComOnBegin#2,"""Ah, energized crystals! If you don't <br>stay close to them, their power <br>will disappear and they'll break!"""
NpcComOnSuccess#2,"""/face2 A great success! <br>Photon activation confirmed! Lots <br>and lots of PSEs should occur now!"""
NpcComOnFailure#2,"""/face4 Too many crystals were destroyed... <br>It's regrettable, but we might as <br>well give up on protecting them."""
NpcComOnDestroy#2,"""Ohh! The $(0) energized <br>crystal has broken!"""
NpcComOnLast#2,"""/face4 Ahh! There's only a few <br>energized crystals left!"""
NpcComOnAddPse#2,"""/face2 Ohh! New energized crystals! Please <br>protect them as well! Defend them <br>and something good will happen!"""
NpcComOnBegin#3,"""励起結晶を守ってください！<br>結晶付近にアークスがいないと<br>結晶の力が減衰してしまいますよ！"""
NpcComOnSuccess#3,"""守りきりました！<br>もう大丈夫です、これでフォトンが<br>活性化してＰＳＥ起こし放題ですよ！"""
NpcComOnFailure#3,"""励起結晶、壊されすぎましたね……<br>仕方がありません、気持ち切り替えて<br>通常任務に戻りましょう。"""
NpcComOnDestroy#3,"""あっ、$(0)の<br>励起結晶が壊れてしまいました！<br>他の結晶を守ってください！"""
NpcComOnLast#3,"""励起結晶、残りわずかです！<br>それだけでも守りきりましょう！"""
NpcComOnAddPse#3,"""おや、新たな励起結晶の出現です。<br>たくさん守れるにこしたことはないので<br>出来るだけ守っていきましょう！"""
