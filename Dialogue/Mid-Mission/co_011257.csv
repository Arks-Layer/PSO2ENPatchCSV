text07#0,"""This will explain about item drops.<br><br>The enemies that appear in Extreme Stages are artificially replicated.<br><br>Because of that, the item drops are very hard to replicate, and they are unstable when they appear.<br><br>Those kinds of items appear with a special icon."""
text08#0,"""Items that drop with this special icon do not go into your Inventory when picked up. Since their data is unstable, they are stored as Virtual Items in a special space.<br><br><yellow>Virtual Items stored in the special space will disappear when you return to the Campship. Only when you complete a Quest, can you take a fixed number of them back with you from the Extreme Terminal.<c>"""
text09#0,"""This will explain about Stage Orders.<br><br>During Extreme Quests, we will give you experimental orders during each stage, known as a 'Stage Order'.<br><br>By fulfilling these orders, you will increase the number of items enemies drop when you defeat them.<br><br>Also, every time you fulfill a certain amount of orders, the amount of items you can take back with you when you complete the Quest will increase."""
text10#0,"""There are certain Stage Orders that require the player to not use any recovery effects in order to complete them. <br><br><yellow>*However, recovery effects from your Mag, ones that automatically activate from a skill, or ones from Cash Shop Items are exceptions to this rule.<c>"""
text11#0,"""This will explain 'Hostile Ability Changes'.<br><br>In Extreme Quests, we have artificially strengthened the enemies in order to create a harsh environment for the Quest. This strengthening is called 'Hostile Ability Changes'.<br><br>However, a Hostile Ability Change that would strengthen a hostile's resistances can be inverted by completing a 'Stage Order' in the previous stage, turning it into an advantage for the player."""
skit01#0,"""Because I felt it was too easy, I've added additional challenges<br>from stage to stage!"""
skit02#0,"""It definitely makes the stage harder, but if you complete the challenge, you can weaken the next enemy, or produce new data!"""
skit03#0,"""Not only that, but completing the challenges will also increase the numbers of items you get to keep at the end of the simulation!"""
skit04#0,"""Hello! Thank you for coming. My name is Karin!"""
skit05#0,"""You've been given the chance to take part in this extreme quest.<br>We'll be seeing a lot of each other!"""
skit06#0,"""Ohohoho!<br>Please proceed to the teleporter.<br>This is where the fun begins!"""
skit07#0,"""一見さんお断りの容赦ない難易度ですが<br>達成できれば、再現データが変化して<br>エネミーが弱くなったりしますよー！"""
