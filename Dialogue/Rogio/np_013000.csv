11_voice_NPC_5012_104#0,"""I can't help but think that if I could have been an ARKS member myself, my fieldwork would go much smoother."""
Rojio_02_020#0,"""That's why I think so much of Aki, who is both an ARKS member and a scientist."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_104#1,"""I wonder why nobody is researching how to acquire the abilities needed to become an ARKS operative."""
Rojio_03_020#0,"""Perhaps I ought to look into it myself. I think I'd need some help to pull it off, though."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_100#0,"""When you study geology and know how a planet is formed, that leads to an understanding of what kinds of resources can be found under its surface."""
Rojio_04_020#0,"""It's an extremely useful field, but it's not very glamorous, I'm afraid."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_100#1,"""My research would have suffered serious setbacks if I hadn't met you,<br><%me>."""
Rojio_05_020#0,"""I will be forever in your debt. I can't thank you enough for your help. No one else would even hear me out."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_103#0,"""Those who hesitate when given the chance to perform essential research are not true scientists. I have to go there."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_100#2,"""Do you see scientists like us as being paranoid and strange? I guess that's only natural."""
Rojio_07_020#0,"""Scientists must have an inquisitive mind. When you no longer have passion for your work, you're done for. So I've learned to accept who I am."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_100#3,"""Thank you so much. I'll be in touch if I have any other requests. Good luck to you."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_104#2,"""This place is a home base for ARKS. I wonder if the Darkers have a base as well?"""
11_voice_NPC_5012_104#3,"""Just between you and me, the official records contain a number of inconsistencies. One day I'd like to get to the bottom of things."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_105#1,"""There are quite a few other scientists in ARKS, but few of them study Photons."""
Rojio_11_020#0,"""Very little data has been disclosed. I wonder why that is? This area of study is core to how ARKS work."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_101#0,"""When you seek the truth, you must accept the associated risks. I don't regret the path I have chosen, no matter the outcome."""
11_voice_NPC_5012_105#2,"""Photons aren't the only area where data is lacking. The same is true for Darkers. Strange, don't you think?"""
11_voice_NPC_5012_105#3,"""I requested some Photon research data the other day, but I have yet to be given access. What could be taking so long?"""
Rojio_18_010#0,"""しばらく見ないうちに<br>みなさんの雰囲気も変わっていて<br>びっくりしました。"""
11_voice_NPC_5012_104#4,"""何事も変わっていくものなんですね。<br>私も、立ち止まってはいられません。"""
Rojio_19_010#0,"""惑星リリーパは、砂漠地帯だけあって<br>すごく乾燥していました。<br>気候が全然違いましたね。"""
Rojio_19_020#0,"""よく口や目に砂が入りましたよ。<br>慣れるまでは大変でした。"""
11_voice_NPC_5012_100#4,"""でも、今となってはいい経験でした。<br>学べることも多くありましたし<br>そうそう出来る事じゃありませんから。"""
Rojio_20_010#0,"""今では、リリーパに逗留できたこと<br>とても貴重な経験だと思っています。"""
Rojio_20_020#0,"""現地へ赴き、研究をする。<br>なかなか出来る事じゃありません。"""
11_voice_NPC_5012_100#5,"""今、その成果をまとめているんです。<br>結構な量になりそうですが<br>書かずにはいられないんですよ。"""
11_voice_NPC_5012_104#5,"""おそらくすべての研究に言えますが<br>ともかくデータを積み重ねることです。"""
Rojio_21_020#0,"""どんな些細なことでも、調べ続ける。<br>リリーパの研究は、その大切さを<br>私に教えてくれました。"""
Rojio_21_030#0,"""今、そのデータや研究内容の<br>役立つ時がきています。<br>研究者冥利に尽きますね。"""
Rojio_mb22_010#0,"""私は自分が行なってきた研究を<br>誇りに思っております。"""
Rojio_mb22_020#0,"""リリーパで積み重ねた研究内容が<br>ああやって役に立ちましたから。"""
Rojio_mb22_030#0,"""これからも私は研究に励みます。<br>学者として、その本分を全うするべく<br>努力を重ねていきますよ。"""
Rojio_mb22_040#0,"""また私が行なった研究が<br>貴方にとってもアークスにとっても<br>役立てることを願っています。"""
Rojio_mb23_010#0,"""リリーパで行なってきた研究データは<br>今、改めて見なおしています。"""
Rojio_mb23_020#0,"""一見すると同じ成分でも<br>構成パターンが違ったりしますし<br>まだまだ解明の余地があります。"""
Rojio_mb23_030#0,"""新たな発見があると嬉しいですね。<br>研究に終わりはありませんから。"""
Rojio_mb23_after_010#0,"""私はアークスではありませんが……<br>貴方の力になりたいと思っています。"""
Rojio_mb23_after_020#0,"""微力ではありますが<br>私に協力できることがあれば<br>なんでも言ってください。"""
Rojio_mb24_after_010#0,"""<%me>さん。<br>今回の出来事についてですが<br>学ばせて頂いたことがあります。"""
Rojio_mb24_after_020#0,"""何よりも強い気持ちを持っていれば<br>望んだ未来を引き寄せられる、と。"""
Rojio_mb24_after_030#0,"""青臭いことかもしれませんが<br>願いを叶えた貴方の姿を見ると<br>そういう風に思うんですよ。"""
Rojio_mb25_010#0,"""研究者として、やれることを<br>精一杯やろうと思っています。"""
Rojio_mb25_020#0,"""貴方を見ていると<br>そういう前向きな気持ちになります。<br>私も負けてられません。"""
st01_010#0,"""<%me>.<br>Did you come all the way out here to see me? I'm... I'm touched, really."""
st01_020#0,"""It's been a long time. We've been waiting two years for you to return."""
11_voice_NPC_5300_104#0,"""I'm pretty busy with my research, so I don't have time to take on anything else right now..."""
st01_020#1,"""I hear the people of Earth look a lot like us."""
st01_030#0,"""It's funny. Out of all the worlds in this great big universe, we found one where the people look just like us."""
11_voice_NPC_5300_100#0,"""This planet Earth is amazing. Not only does it have a stable climate, but its environment is exactly what we find most comfortable."""
st01_020#2,"""I'd love to get a chance to study it."""
st01_010#1,"""I figured I'd be turned down, but I applied for permission to study the Earth anyway. Sure enough, I was denied."""
st01_020#3,"""There's all this weird stuff going on, and it turned out we have enemies over there, so I guess Command are trying to avoid getting their attention."""
st01_030#1,"""We have no idea what they're even capable of, so it makes sense to be cautious."""
11_voice_NPC_5300_104#1,"""I suppose researching Earth is completely off the table for now."""
st01_020#4,"""I'm glad it wasn't Darkers that boarded us, but it worries me that they were able to bypass the limiter..."""
st01_010#2,"""For \""evolution\""...<br>He really thinks that justifies everything he's doing, doesn't he? But he's wrong."""
11_voice_NPC_5300_104#2,"""Trying to force change where it isn't wanted or needed will collapse the entire system. You have to stop him."""
Emilia_01_10#0,"""Hello, <%me>. Is something up?"""
Emilia_01_20#0,"""...A visitor from another world, huh? Intriguing."""
Emilia_01_30#0,"""If they crash-landed on Naberius, maybe the data I've been gathering there will be useful..."""
Emilia_01_40#0,"""Oh, they need technical help? Well, I can't say no to somebody in need. I'd be happy to help out."""
st01_010#3,"""This situation didn't start on Earth. It began right here, as another product of the Photoners' dark legacy."""
st01_020#5,"""From what I understand, inhumane experiments were commonplace back then. Forced evolution included."""
11_voice_NPC_5300_104#3,"""Could our civilization end up going the same way? It's up to all of us to make sure that it doesn't."""
11_voice_NPC_5300_104#4,"""This battle against the [Profound Darkness] will be a turning point for ARKS. I can just feel it."""
11_voice_NPC_5300_104#5,"""I'm glad you're safe, <%me>.<br>But what happened to the [Profound Darkness]...?"""
sq13_010#0,"""So, this Goddess of Demise used the energy from the [Profound Darkness] to return to our world."""
11_voice_NPC_5300_104#6,"""Does that mean the original [Profound Darkness] is gone...?<br>Somehow, I doubt we've got so lucky..."""
11_voice_NPC_5300_105#0,"""Hi. We scientists are busy too. We're searching through all our archives, records, even literature..."""
ep6_sq00_02#0,"""It's all we can do, so leave it to us."""
ep6_sq00_03#0,"""That A.I.S. researcher gets so lost in her work that she forgets to sleep and eat."""
11_voice_NPC_5300_104#7,"""Oh, it's you. It sounds like we've got a difficult job ahead..."""
ep6_sq01_02#0,"""...But if I give up now, Professor Aki will laugh at me. I have to keep doing the best I can."""
ep6_sq02_01#0,"""That was a difficult situation, but we got through it, thanks to you. Thank you for everything you've done."""
ep6_sq02_02#0,"""And we got a sample of Dragoncrystals out of it...<br>I'd call that a good result. I've started researching them in my spare time."""
11_voice_NPC_5300_101#0,"""Using the correlation between the other world and the real one to create a cosmic-scale trap was an inspired idea."""
text02#0,"""And putting that idea into action required a strategy that would bring all of ARKS together. That you were able to pull that off..."""
text03#0,"""Oh, I'm sorry. I almost forgot to thank you. For saving the entire universe, you have my sincere gratitude. Thank you."""
