11_voice_NPC_03_100#0,"""Hey, what are you up to, partner? Hm? You were asked to do something by that cat?"""
Kuro_01_020#0,"""You really are something, aren't you? So, what did it ask you to do?"""
Kuro_01_030#0,"""Hmm, it was asking about a cute girl? So, why are you coming to me?"""
Kuro_01_040#0,"""Wait, a cute girl? What the hell?! I'm a guy!"""
Kuro_01_050#0,"""Damn!  If you see that cat again, let me know! Don't forget it!"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_101#0,"""Oh, nice timing, partner."""
Afin_favs_before_020#0,"""There was something I wanted to give you. Here, take this."""
Afin_favs_before_030#0,"""I won't use it, so it's better off in your hands."""
Afin_favs_after_010#0,"""No need to thank me. We're partners, right?"""
Afin_favs_after_020#0,"""You're always looking out for me. It's the least I could do! Haha!"""
Afin_favs_present_010#0,"""Received \""Synthesizer\"" from Afin."""

11_voice_NPC_5003_101#1,"""Wow, this place is huge! Quite a difference from where I lived before. Well, that place was big too, though."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#0,"""There were a lot of Darkers at the start, but somehow we made it through. We must be super lucky! Haha."""
Afin_02_020#0,"""I was pretty distracted, but I somehow managed to push forward. """
11_voice_NPC_5003_106#0,"""Even after becoming an ARKS, life still goes on. I thought things would have been stricter."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_108#0,"""Since you're still inexperienced, the amount of planets you can go to are limited. """
Afin_04_020#0,"""If you want to go to more planets, then work hard to be recognized. The road ahead is a long one."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#0,"""Even though ARKS have a high standing, that doesn't mean they can do whatever they want. """
Afin_05_020#0,"""There have been times when some outrageous actions have been overlooked, though. ...Unofficially."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#1,"""It's so nice here. I want to relax all the time. But as soon as there is a mission, I have to leave...."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#2,"""There are so many skills. It's hard to remember them all, isn't it? """
Afin_07_020#0,"""But, if you can remember them, then they're really useful. Let's keep it up!"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#1,"""Hmmm. I don't have any good weapons. I wonder if there are some new ones I could get...."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_105#0,"""The goal is to find people, so only carry light weapons!"""
Afin_09_020#0,"""...Even if you say that, you still got mad and fought seriously. I didn't mean to come off as unfaithful."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_105#1,"""We can change classes, but the higher ranks have already chosen theirs. Why did it change...?"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#2,"""There are some ARKS that are not only good at fighting, but also at gathering info. I wonder if I'm the same...."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#3,"""I knew finding people would be hard, but this will take a while. Guess I'll just have to be patient."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_109#0,"""More Darkers appeared! At least that's what it feels like a lot these days. Maybe it's just me?"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_101#2,"""Seeing you complete so many client orders is making me happy, too. Hehe."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_108#1,"""I was told by my superiors that “you don't have any courage, but you know that.” A bit harsh, don't you think?"""
Afin_15_020#0,"""The thing that's scary is that there are people who think they have courage when they don't. ...Guess they're just reckless."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_105#2,"""I've been thinking. The Darkers have been our enemies for a while now, but it hasn't been properly been recorded in history...."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#4,"""ARKS are...loved by everyone. But I never thought it would be this tiring...ha."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#3,"""The best ARKS...the Council of Six?  I guess. They're all pretty strong."""
Afin_18_020#0,"""I was just on a walk. Weren't you just here?"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_109#1,"""It's weird how the ARKS ship can be attacked directly and no one panics. I guess it happens too often for people to get upset."""
Afin_19_020#0,"""...I feel like there is something wrong with you if you think that that is normal."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#5,"""I didn't join ARKS because I wanted to protect someone."""
Afin_20_020#0,"""Like, I thought if we get attacked here, I end up thinking I want to protect everyone. It's weird to think about."""
11_voice_NPC_03_104#0,"""Ever since Dark Falz's revival, everyone's been on edge."""
Afin_mb9_020#0,"""Well, I might be stating the obvious, but it's no use feeling down about it."""
11_voice_NPC_03_106#0,"""Seems like there are a lot of rumours flying around."""
Afin_mb10_020#0,"""There are some super-strong people out there, so be careful."""
11_voice_NPC_03_104#1,"""Well, I think it's good to let off a little steam in the ARKS Battle Tournament every once and a while."""
Afin_mb11_020#0,"""Looks like a lot of people are joining in...what should I do?"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_105#3,"""...Ah, my bad partner. I was spacing out."""
Afin_mb12_020#0,"""I know I can't solve anything just by thinking about it...but I'm bad at acting on my thoughts."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_105#4,"""...Ah, my bad partner. I was spacing out."""
Afin_mb13_020#0,"""I know I can't solve anything just by thinking about it...but I'm bad at acting on my thoughts."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#6,"""The Quarry on Planet Lillipa....I feel like there's something there."""
Afin_mb14_020#0,"""Ah, it's not really a \""get rich quick\"" thing. That gets old pretty fast. """
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#7,"""This...seems like a joke. My sister that I was separated from is Dark Falz...what's happening?"""
Afin_mb15_020#0,"""If that's the case, then I should just stop suffering...."""
Afin_mb15_030#0,"""...No. If you're going to keep living, then things will work out. I'm sure everything will be fine."""
Afin_mb16_010#0,"""This...seems like a joke. My sister that I was separated from is Dark Falz...what's happening?"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_105#5,"""If that's the case, then I should just stop suffering....."""
Afin_mb16_030#0,"""...No. If you're going to keep living, then things will work out. I'm sure everything will be fine."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#8,"""...Partner. That turned out to be amazing."""
Afin_mb16zeno_020#0,"""You really seem to get caught up in everything. ...I feel sorry for you. It must be tough."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#9,"""Hey, partner. So much has changed since we became ARKS, hasn't it?"""
Afin_mb18_020#0,"""Things are changing everywhere...I'll try my best to adapt."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#4,"""You're always so positive. We have the power to change things, so I won't give up!"""
Afin_mb19_020#0,"""If only I could keep pushing forward constantly. It's so hard...."""
Afin_mb20_010#0,"""You seem as busy as ever. Me? Still no trace of my sister to be found."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#10,"""We investigated around the mining base, but I think we'll have to switch up our methods."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#5,"""Watching you makes me want to do my best, too!"""
Afin_mb21_020#0,"""It sounds like there has been a lot of sightings of my sister around the mining base."""
Afin_mb21_030#0,"""You didn't give up no matter what. I just need to push forward like you and find my sister!"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#6,"""Partner, thanks for everything. Thanks to you, I was able to meet my sister. """
Afin_mb22_020#0,"""But there is still a lot for me to think about."""
Afin_mb22_030#0,"""We've come this far. I won't give up now."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#7,"""Hey, partner. Looks like you've been through a lot. I'm glad you're okay, though."""
Afin_mb23_020#0,"""What about me? It's the same old with my sister. She runs at the sight of me."""
Afin_mb23_030#0,"""But...I won't give up. I finally got to meet her, after all."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#8,"""Are you okay, partner? When they told me you were taking a break, I got worried."""
Afin_mb23_after_020#0,"""Your ego's pretty big, but I think you should rely on those around you a little more."""
Afin_mb23_after_030#0,"""Don't work too hard. If you need anything, just ask!"""
