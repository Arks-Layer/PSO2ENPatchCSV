Kuro_01_020#0,"""You really are something, aren't you? So, what did it ask you to do?"""
Kuro_01_030#0,"""Hmm, it was asking about a cute girl? So, why are you coming to me?"""
Kuro_01_040#0,"""Wait, a cute girl? What the hell?! I'm a guy!"""
Kuro_01_050#0,"""Damn it! If you see that cat again, let me know! Don't forget it!"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_101#0,"""Oh, nice timing, partner."""
Afin_favs_before_020#0,"""There was something I wanted to give you. Here, take this."""
Afin_favs_before_030#0,"""I won't use it, so it's better off in your hands."""
Afin_favs_after_010#0,"""No need to thank me. We're partners, right?"""
Afin_favs_after_020#0,"""You're always looking out for me. It's the least I could do! Haha!"""

11_voice_NPC_5003_101#1,"""Wow... This place is huge! It's way different from where I lived before. Well, that place was pretty big too."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#0,"""I can't believe we survived running into Darkers on our very first mission. We must be super lucky! Haha."""
Afin_02_020#0,"""It was pretty scary at the time, but now that I can look back on it, I feel good about how we handled it."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_106#0,"""I was surprised to find out that ARKS basically live normal lives. I was expecting things to be a lot stricter."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_108#0,"""We're still pretty new, so the places and planets we can go to are limited."""
Afin_04_020#0,"""If we want to go to more places, we'll have to prove ourselves first. We've got a long road ahead of us, partner."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#0,"""As ARKS, we command a lot of respect, but that doesn't mean we can just do whatever we want."""
Afin_05_020#0,"""They might let us get away with unbecoming behaviour from time to time, but make no mistake, they're always watching us."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#1,"""It's so nice here. I want to spend all my time relaxing. But as soon as they assign me a mission, I have to leave..."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#2,"""There's a lot of different skills, aren't there? It's kind of hard to remember them all."""
Afin_07_020#0,"""Still, you never know when they could come in handy, so I guess I should just knuckle down and learn them."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#1,"""Hmmm... I don't have any good weapons. I wonder if there are any new ones I could get?"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_105#0,"""I joined ARKS to look for someone, so I prefer to use lighter weapons."""
Afin_09_020#0,"""...But when I tell people that, they get mad at me because they think I don't take fighting seriously. I don't want to come off like I'm not serious."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_105#1,"""We can switch our class freely, but the older ARKS don't have that option.<br>...I wonder what changed?"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#2,"""Not all ARKS are fighters. I've heard a rumor saying that there's a team of ARKS who buy and sell information.<br>...I wonder if I could do that?"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#3,"""I knew finding someone out there wouldn't be easy, but this is taking way longer than I thought. I guess I'll just have to be patient."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_109#0,"""Even more Darkers! It feels like we've been running into them all over the place lately. Maybe it's just me."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_101#2,"""Seeing you complete so many Client Orders is making me happy, too. Haha."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_108#1,"""The other day, one of the other ARKS told me \""You don't have any courage, but at least you're aware of that.\"" That's a bit harsh, don't you think?"""
Afin_15_020#0,"""The scary part is that there's people out there who don't have any more courage than I do, but think they do.<br>...I guess they're just reckless."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_105#2,"""I was wondering. How long have the Darkers have been our enemies? History was never my strong point."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#4,"""Everyone looks up to us ARKS...<br>I never realized the job would be this tiring, though... Ha..."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#3,"""Who are the strongest ARKS? I guess that would be the Council of Six. I wonder what they're like. Do you think they're all super-buff?"""
Afin_18_020#0,"""...Huh? You say they're out in the field right now? Does that mean you've met them already?"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_109#1,"""It's funny how everyone's so calm even though the ARKS ship was just attacked. I guess people around here must be used to that kind of thing."""
Afin_19_020#0,"""...I feel like there's something wrong with you if you think that's normal."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#5,"""I didn't think I was joining ARKS to protect other people, but..."""
Afin_20_020#0,"""I mean, it's natural to step in when your home gets attacked, isn't it? For some reason, it's got me second-guessing myself."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#6,"""The mood around here has been really heavy lately. It's probably because Dark Falz is back, huh?"""
Afin_mb9_020#0,"""Under the circumstances, I can understand why people would be feeling a bit depressed."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_106#1,"""I've heard quite a few rumors about that berserk dragon."""
Afin_mb10_020#0,"""They say that thing's crazy strong, so if you see it, be careful."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#7,"""That Battle Championship thing sounds interesting. I guess it's good to blow off some steam once in a while."""
Afin_mb11_020#0,"""It sounds like a lot of people are planning to take part...<br>I wonder if I should sign up?"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_105#3,"""............<br>Oh, sorry partner. I was lost in thought."""
Afin_mb12_020#0,"""I know I'll never get anything done just by thinking about it...<br>But I'm no good at putting my thoughts into action."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_105#4,"""............<br>Oh, sorry partner. I was lost in thought."""
Afin_mb13_020#0,"""I know I'll never get anything done just by thinking about it...<br>But I'm no good at putting my thoughts into action."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#8,"""...Hey, partner. About before...<br>...No, I shouldn't bother you. Don't worry about it."""
Afin_mb14_020#0,"""If I have time to worry, I have time to act. I just have this feeling...<br>There's something about the Quarry on planet Lillipa..."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#9,"""...This can't be happening. My sister turns up alive, only she's a Dark Falz..."""
Afin_mb15_020#0,"""Maybe I should just give up and accept that she's gone..."""
Afin_mb15_030#0,"""...No. As long as she's alive, there must be a way to bring her back. I'll find a way."""
Afin_mb16_010#0,"""...This can't be happening. My sister turns up alive, only she's a Dark Falz..."""

Afin_mb16_030#0,"""...No. As long as she's alive, there must be a way to bring her back. I'll find a way."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#10,"""Hey, partner. You became a heck of a big deal when I wasn't looking, huh?"""
Afin_mb16zeno_020#0,"""I had no idea you were the type to get tangled up at the center of things like you have...<br>Honestly, I feel a little sorry for you."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#11,"""Yo, partner. Things have changed a lot since we joined ARKS, huh?"""
Afin_mb18_020#0,"""I mean, the overhauls around here happened practically overnight...<br>I guess I'll just have to try and adapt."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#4,"""You always seem to have such a positive attitude. I guess the reason you can get so much done is that you never give up."""
Afin_mb19_020#0,"""I wish I could be as daring as you...<br>...It's just not in my nature."""
Afin_mb20_010#0,"""This is hopeless. I've been working on this for ages, and I still haven't found a trace of my sister."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#12,"""I heard she showed up around the mining base, so I've been focusing my efforts there...<br>Well, I knew it wouldn't be easy."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#5,"""Watching you gives me the determination I need to keep going."""
Afin_mb21_020#0,"""I've heard there's been a lot of sightings of my sister out near the mining base."""
Afin_mb21_030#0,"""You never gave up, no matter what. I just have to act like you do. Then I'll find my sister."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#6,"""Thanks for everything, partner. It's thanks to your determination that I was able to meet my sister."""
Afin_mb22_020#0,"""I still have a lot to think about, though."""
Afin_mb22_030#0,"""I've come this far. I'm not going to give up now."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#7,"""Yo, partner. Sounds like you went through a lot. I'm glad you're alright."""
Afin_mb23_020#0,"""Me? I'm still trying to get through to my sister. So far, she just runs away whenever I get near her."""
Afin_mb23_030#0,"""But I won't give up. Not now."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#8,"""How are you doing, partner? When I heard what happened to you, I was worried sick."""
Afin_mb23_after_020#0,"""I know you've got a lot to deal with, but remember, it's OK to rely on other people once in a while."""
Afin_mb23_after_030#0,"""Don't try and bear the weight of the world all by yourself. If you need my help, all you have to do is ask."""
