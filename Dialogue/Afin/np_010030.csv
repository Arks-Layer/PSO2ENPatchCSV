Kuro_01_030#0,"""Hmm, it was asking about a cute girl? So, why are you coming to me?"""
Kuro_01_040#0,"""Wait, a cute girl? What the hell?! I'm a guy!"""
Kuro_01_050#0,"""Damn! If you see that cat again, let me know! Don't forget it!"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_101#0,"""Oh, nice timing, partner."""
Afin_favs_before_020#0,"""There was something I wanted to give you. Here, take this."""
Afin_favs_before_030#0,"""I won't use it, so it's better off in your hands."""

11_voice_NPC_5003_100#0,"""There were a lot of Darkers at the start, but somehow we made it through. We must be super lucky! Haha."""
Afin_02_020#0,"""I was pretty distracted, but I somehow managed to push forward. """
11_voice_NPC_5003_106#0,"""Even after becoming an ARKS, life still goes on. I thought things would have been stricter."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_108#0,"""Since you're still inexperienced, the amount of planets you can go to are limited. """
Afin_04_020#0,"""If you want to go to more planets, then work hard to be recognized. The road ahead is a long one."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#0,"""Even though ARKS have a high standing, that doesn't mean they can do whatever they want."""
Afin_05_020#0,"""There have been times when some outrageous actions have been overlooked, though. ...Unofficially."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#1,"""It's so nice here. I want to relax all the time. But as soon as there's a mission, I have to leave..."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#2,"""There are so many skills. It's hard to remember them all, isn't it?"""
Afin_07_020#0,"""But if you can remember them, they can be really useful. Let's keep it up!"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#1,"""Hmmm. I don't have any good weapons. I wonder if there are some new ones I could get..."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_105#0,"""The goal is to find people, so only carry light weapons!"""
Afin_09_020#0,"""...Even if you say that, you still got mad and fought seriously. I didn't mean to come off as unfaithful."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_105#1,"""We can change classes, but the higher ranks have already chosen theirs. Why did it change...?"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#2,"""There are some ARKS that are not only good at fighting, but also at gathering info. I wonder if I'm the same..."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#3,"""I knew finding people would be hard, but this will take a while. Guess I'll just have to be patient."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_109#0,"""More Darkers appeared! At least that's what it feels like a lot these days. Maybe it's just me?"""

11_voice_NPC_5003_108#1,"""I was told by my superiors that \""you don't have any courage, but you know that\"". A bit harsh, don't you think?"""
Afin_15_020#0,"""The thing that's scary is that there are people who think they have courage when they don't. ...Guess they're just reckless."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_105#2,"""I've been thinking. The Darkers have been our enemies for a while now, but it hasn't been properly been recorded in history..."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#4,"""ARKS are... loved by everyone. But I never thought it would be this tiring... ha."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#3,"""The best ARKS... the Council of Six? I guess. They're all pretty strong."""
Afin_18_020#0,"""I was just on a walk. Weren't you just here?"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_109#1,"""It's weird how the ARKS ship can be attacked directly and no one panics. I guess it happens too often for people to get upset."""
Afin_19_020#0,"""...I feel like there's something wrong with you if you think that that's normal."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#5,"""I didn't join ARKS because I wanted to protect someone."""

Afin_mb20_010#0,"""You seem as busy as ever. Me? Still no trace of my sister to be found."""

Afin_mb21_020#0,"""It sounds like there has been a lot of sightings of my sister around the mining base."""
Afin_mb21_030#0,"""You didn't give up no matter what. I just need to push forward like you and find my sister!"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#6,"""Partner, thanks for everything. Thanks to you, I was able to meet my sister. """
Afin_mb22_020#0,"""But there is still a lot for me to think about."""

Afin_mb23_020#0,"""What about me? It's the same old with my sister. She runs at the sight of me."""
Afin_mb23_030#0,"""But... I won't give up. I finally got to meet her, after all."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#8,"""Are you okay, partner? When they told me you were taking a break, I got worried."""
