mb25_after_010#0,"""It feels kind of strange to be here on the ARKS Ship."""
mb25_after_020#0,"""I'm pretty sure people are looking at me funny, but there's no helping that. I was your enemy, after all."""
mb25_after_030#0,"""Look, I'm fine. But, uh...<br>Thanks for checking up on me."""
mb25_after_040#0,"""A-anyway...! If you have time to stand around chatting with me, you should be using that time to relax properly. Take care of yourself, OK?"""
11_voice_NPC_5227_100#1,"""Hmm... Oh, you're back."""
st01_020#0,"""Your physical condition looks... fine. Aurora doesn't have anything to say, so I guess the cleansing went well?"""
st01_030#0,"""I appreciate you coming to see me, but you should go talk to the others. Everyone wants to meet you."""
11_voice_NPC_5227_100#2,"""アウロラ？\u3000なんでも武器姿の方が<br>本人的に楽みたいで、最近はもっぱら<br>その姿のままのんびりしてるわよ。"""
st01_020#1,"""人型になってた時もあったけど<br>見た目的に目立つからね。<br>質問攻めにうんざりしたみたい。"""
st01_030#1,"""……反論もないし、今も寝てるわね。<br>ま、そのうち会えるんじゃない？"""
11_voice_NPC_5227_100#3,"""Didn't take long for things to get exciting around here once you were woken up."""
st01_020#2,"""You're a good person, but you do tend to plough ahead without thinking whether you're getting the people around you into trouble..."""
st01_030#2,"""I'm not complaining, it worked out for me. Just, please try to be careful."""
st01_010#0,"""人が相手……か。<br>今更ためらうようなものでもないわ。"""
st01_020#3,"""ハルコタンだってアムドゥスキアだって<br>相手は意志ある存在だったでしょ。<br>それと同じだと、あたしは思うわ。"""
st01_030#3,"""……何にせよ、気にしすぎるなって事。<br>主に戦う相手は、幻創種なんだからね。"""
11_voice_NPC_5227_104#0,"""So, her embodied weapon broke...<br>I didn't know that could happen."""
st01_020#4,"""They're manifestations of their user's heart, so maybe her weapon breaking shows her heart was broken too..."""
st01_010#1,"""折れたのは武器じゃなくて心。<br>だから、心が戻れば武器も戻る。<br>さらに強さと輝きを増して、ね。"""
st01_020#5,"""とんでもない荒療治だけども<br>そのヒツギって子にとっては<br>越えるべき壁だったんじゃないかしら。"""
st01_030#4,"""自分の心、本当の心と向き合うのって<br>本当に、辛くて大変だからね。"""
st01_010#2,"""We didn't pick up any signs of Dark Falz on that kid. As far as I'm concerned, he isn't one any more."""
st01_020#6,"""That's just my point of view, anyway. I don't know what ARKS thinks about it officially."""
st01_030#5,"""Nobody should let other people decide who they are for them. I wonder what Aru thinks he is?"""
st01_010#3,"""……アルって子、戻って来たんでしょ？<br>良かったわね、助け出せて。"""
st01_020#7,"""口ではいろいろ言ってると思うけど<br>内心はとっても不安だったはずよ。<br>いっそう優しくしてあげるといいわ。"""
st01_010#4,"""So in the end, we were just cleaning up after the Photoners on Earth, too."""
st01_020#8,"""I've asked Aurora about it, but she claims not to remember much. To be honest, I don't mind not getting into it."""
st01_030#6,"""Mostly she just remembers how beautiful or ugly things were back then. She didn't exactly pick up on a lot of important details."""
sq00_010#0,"""Rescuing someone from Dark Falz possession is one thing, but trying to save the host of the [Profound Darkness]? ARKS must be crazy."""
11_voice_NPC_5227_101#0,"""Still, this might just be crazy enough to work. I'll help out in any way I can."""
11_voice_NPC_5227_101#1,"""Welcome back.<br>...I wasn't worried. Everyone else seemed relaxed about your chances."""
sq01_020#0,"""Even Aurora was sure you'd be safe.<br>...Not that I care what she thinks."""
11_voice_NPC_5227_104#1,"""A lot of people have been saying that Darker appearance rates are down...<br>Is that really true?"""
sq02_020#0,"""You know they could just be building up their forces, right?<br>...I hate to spoil the mood, but we have to consider every possibility."""
sq10_010#0,"""...Not one word out of you about what happened back there. Especially not to Afin."""
sq10_020#0,"""...I'm not embarrassed. I just don't want him to worry about me. He's such a nuisance when he's worried."""
sq13_010#0,"""...Shiva, Goddess of Demise. I asked Aurora about her, but she'd never heard the name before."""
sq13_020#0,"""She's similar to the Twenty Gods of the Photoners, but she's unique. She was intended to be sacrificed from the day she was born."""
sq13_030#0,"""I'm sympathetic to her situation...<br>But that doesn't give her the right to take revenge on the entire world."""
ep6_sq00_01#0,"""I've spent a while with the Information Division, having Aurora tell them everything she knows."""
ep6_sq00_02#0,"""Unfortunately, she couldn't give them any leads on how to defeat Shiva. I hope we can find something soon..."""
11_voice_NPC_5227_108#0,"""We don't even know when she's going to attack us.<br>...It's the waiting I can't stand."""
11_voice_NPC_5227_109#0,"""We've been working so hard on strengthening ourselves, but they just walked right into the core...<br>...We can't let them get away with this."""
11_voice_NPC_5227_105#0,"""And Shiva's followers are dangerous too. That Mitra girl has the ability to disguise herself as our allies."""
ep6_sq01_03#0,"""...But we can't waste time on mourning. Our only hope is to search Amduscia for whatever Sara believes we will find there."""
11_voice_NPC_5227_101#2,"""Once again, you've restored hope to us all...<br>Even when I gave up, you never did."""
ep6_sq02_02#0,"""That's how you've always been. Thanks to that, we're back on stable footing. And I... I won't ever give up again."""
ep6_sq02_03#0,"""This is the turning point. It's time I stiffened my resolve."""
ep6_sq02_01_01#0,"""According to Aurora, the two Gods accompanying Shiva were innocents who got dragged into the Photoners' schemes..."""
11_voice_NPC_5227_105#1,"""...It must have been hard for Harriet. Watching everyone she believed in become corrupted, unable to look away..."""
11_voice_NPC_5227_105#2,"""...The power of Shiva is unbelievable. But the others aren't on the same level."""
ep6_sq02_0102_02#0,"""We aren't a match for their power yet, but I think we're making progress."""
ep6_sq02_0102_03#0,"""...So we'll do what I've always done. We'll believe in you and fight."""
ep6_sq03_02_01_01#0,"""Everything else that happened aside, you've defeated one of Shiva's most dangerous followers."""
11_voice_NPC_5227_100#4,"""I can't speak for anyone else, but it seems like we're making progress to me."""
11_voice_NPC_5227_100#5,"""I heard we've finally got a lead on how to defeat Shiva."""
ep6_sq04_01_02#0,"""...I'm still worried. But we're definitely making progress. Even if we're forced to take one step back, we've already taken three steps forward."""
ep6_sq04_01_03#0,"""The situation is still tough, but I have hope that we'll make it through."""
text01#0,"""I always believed in you, no matter how bad things looked, but still..."""
text02#0,"""None of us were even able to make a dent in Shiva's defences before...<br>I still can't quite believe we've won."""
11_voice_NPC_5227_101#3,"""...Thank you. You've made everyone's hopes and wishes come true. You're a miracle-worker."""
