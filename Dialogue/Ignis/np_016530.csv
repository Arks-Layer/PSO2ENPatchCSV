text01#0,"""Oh, it's you, Leader. Strange? What do you mean? What's so strange about our being here?"""
11_voice_NPC_5655_101#0,"""See! I told you! If we wait here, Leader is sure to show up!"""
11_voice_NPC_5654_905#0,"""Huh? You want to know why we're standing here?"""
text04#0,"""Seraphy gave us a mission. To be precise...<br>Our mission is to assist you, Master."""
11_voice_NPC_5653_904#0,"""...Hmm, that's right. Leader, if you have any free time, could you speak to me?"""
text01#1,"""You seem to be busy today. Standing here, we've had a good view of your activities."""
text02#0,"""Running around all over the place on missions, taking on requests from your fellow ARKS...<br>You truly are a good person."""
11_voice_NPC_5653_901#0,"""You go wherever you're needed and do whatever you must, regardless of whether you're seen doing it or not. I suppose... I can appreciate that attitude, just a little."""
text01#2,"""I've heard a lot of rumors about you around here."""
11_voice_NPC_5653_101#0,"""I was surprised to hear you had a side like that to you. Not in a bad way, though. You're quite an interesting person, you know."""
text01#3,"""Am I ready to deploy at any time? Heheh... But of course. I exist in a constant state of preparedness."""
11_voice_NPC_5653_901#1,"""If you're not ready... I can wait. The success or failure of any operation depends on how well you prepare. If you call yourself a professional, don't neglect your preparations."""
text01#4,"""I thought that I alone would have been sufficient for this mission...<br>But I now see the value of having a team behind you."""
11_voice_NPC_5653_904#1,"""Hehe... It took me a little by surprise. The way everyone's individual quirks lead to unpredictable behaviour. But it wasn't too bad, in the end."""
11_voice_NPC_5653_900#0,"""Because you were there, I was able to befriend the others.<br>...I am grateful to you, Leader."""
text04#1,"""I've never really talked to other people before...<br>Aside from on missions, that is."""
11_voice_NPC_5653_901#2,"""It feels good to have friends.<br>Leader... Thank you. Hehe... I hope you'll be able to continue helping me."""
