11_voice_NPC_5272_105#0,"""Huh...? You think it's because I listen to people and take them seriously, so I seem reliable? Well, if you say so, I guess that must be it."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#0,"""There aren't many other Dewmans around here, huh? Are they all out on missions?"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_105#0,"""There's a lot of tall people around, so my neck gets tired from looking up all the time."""

Npc91_mb09_020#0,"""Could you imagine if it had been at full power? We wouldn't have stood a chance."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#4,"""That berserk dragon is a hot topic right now, but I've never seen it, so I don't have anything to tell you."""
Npc91_mb10_020#0,"""If it's berserk, does that mean it attacks everything around it, no matter where it goes?"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#5,"""A Battle Championship? I'm not really interested. I'll stick to the sidelines."""

11_voice_NPC_5091_104#6,"""I often see you talking with all kinds of people, senpai. You have a lot of friends in ARKS, don't you?"""
Npc91_mb14_020#0,"""I'm more comfortable on my own, but it can get a bit lonely.<br>...I'm a little jealous."""
Npc91_mb14_030#0,"""...What's up with that expression? You think I'm weird, don't you? Oh, no, I knew this would happen!"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#7,"""Would I like to talk to other ARKS more? No, I'm alright as I am now. That's not really my kind of thing."""
Npc91_mb15_020#0,"""I didn't join ARKS to make friends. I prefer to keep myself to myself."""
Npc91_mb15_030#0,"""Besides, I have you to talk to, senpai."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_105#1,"""...I've got a bad feeling about this. I can't say what it is exactly, but I'm feeling really uncomfortable."""
Npc91_mb16_020#0,"""...You seem alright though, senpai. You aren't gonna go  disappearing on me all of a sudden, are you??"""
Npc91_mb16_030#0,"""Being able to talk to you has been really helpful. If I lost you...<br>Things would get a lot harder for me."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#6,"""...Oh! Senpai, you're safe! Thank goodness..."""
Npc91_mb16zeno_020#0,"""Haha... I'm so relieved, I'm actually feeling a bit faint. I don't know what to say."""
Npc91_mb16zeno_030#0,"""Senpai... thank you so much. Being able to see you again, to talk to you like this...<br>It makes me so happy."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_106#1,"""The mood in ARKS has changed a surprising amount recently. You think so too, right, senpai?"""
Npc91_mb18_020#0,"""It feels like they've been more transparent when they communicate with us, right? I'm usually alone, so I pick up on these things."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#7,"""Is it because of what you did six months ago?<br>...I think I like it better this way."""
Npc91_mb19_010#0,"""Recently, I've been talking to more people aside from you."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#8,"""I'm still not very good at talking to people, but...<br>I don't think it's been going too badly."""
Npc91_mb19_030#0,"""But talking to you is easier. I feel like I can speak more freely. So, come talk to me any time you like."""
Npc91_mb20_010#0,"""Hey, senpai. If you've got a minute, want to hang out and talk?"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#8,"""...N-no, I didn't have anything in mind. There's nothing to worry about, I just wanted to talk to you."""
Npc91_mb20_030#0,"""You don't have to treat me like a little kid. I'm fine, really."""
Npc91_mb21_010#0,"""Yo, senpai. Huh? You're wondering why I'm not hanging out with Patty and Tia today?"""
Npc91_mb21_020#0,"""You saw what happened last time. Why would you even have to ask me that?"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_106#2,"""Ahh... Just thinking about it is embarrassing...<br>Senpai, please just forget that ever happened..."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#9,"""Whew... O-oh, it's you, senpai. Why was I sighing? Haha, it's nothing."""
Npc91_mb22_020#0,"""It's the first time I've had to myself for a while, so I was just trying to relax myself. That's all."""
Npc91_mb22_030#0,"""There really is nothing to worry about, I'm fine. Thanks for your concern, though."""
Npc91_mb23_010#0,"""Say, where's Matoi? Are you on your own? That's rare these days."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#10,"""Ah, sorry, it's nothing. It's just, I see you two together so much, when you aren't it makes me wonder if something's happened."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#9,"""Haha, there I go, worrying about nothing. Everyone winds up alone from time to time, right? I shouldn't let it bother me."""
Npc91_mb23_after_010#0,"""...Why did things have to turn out this way?"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#11,"""If only I'd been there, maybe I could have done something..."""
Npc91_mb23_after_030#0,"""All I can do now is wish I had as much power as you do, senpai."""
Npc91_mb24_010#0,"""There's a lot of things I want to say to Matoi when she comes back."""
Npc91_mb24_020#0,"""I was really sad when I heard she'd disappeared. It felt like... like I might never be happy again."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#10,"""So, senpai...<br>It might sound strange coming from me, but I'll ask you anyway. Please bring Matoi back home."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#11,"""Hey, senpai! Thank goodness...<br>I was hoping I'd run into you."""
Npc91_mb24_after_020#0,"""This probably sounds strange coming from me, but... thank you. Thank you for bringing Matoi back."""
Npc91_mb24_after_030#0,"""I was really glad to see her again. Thank you so, so much."""
Npc91_mb25_010#0,"""You throw yourself into every issue around, don't you, senpai?"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_102#0,"""Now you're getting involved with the Lillipans too."""
Npc91_mb25_030#0,"""I get that you're the type of person who likes to help out, but...<br>You should really pace yourself."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_104#1,"""I've been waiting for you...<br>Never thought I'd have a reason to say something like that. It feels like facing a brand new enemy."""
st01_020#0,"""For you, it's only been a few moments since you last saw us. But we've been waiting for a long time..."""
st01_030#0,"""...Well, you're back now. And you even came to see me... I'm glad."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_104#2,"""I hear the Summoner class is all about fighting alongside your Pet, but I don't know what that actually looks like."""
st01_020#1,"""To be honest, I don't think I'll ever be good with anything but Braver. I'm still too inexperienced to learn any new classes."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_104#3,"""I've been sent to investigate the Earth too."""
st01_020#2,"""I've been getting a strange feeling down there, and I think I've figured out why."""
st01_030#1,"""There's no Darkers in Tokyo. We've been fighting them for so long that not having them around feels weird."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_104#4,"""Is Matoi still off-duty? I guess I got used to seeing her with you, so not having her around is weird."""
st01_020#3,"""She woke up about six months ago, but she went back into Cold Sleep soon after, so I didn't get much of a chance to talk to her."""
st01_030#2,"""I know she's not gone for good, but it feels a bit lonely without all the old familiar faces around."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_100#1,"""I was surprised how cute Pets are. I guess it's nice to have creatures like that around."""
st01_020#4,"""They seem different from Mags, somehow, but I can't place how."""
st01_010#0,"""So, Hitsugi's back. She has a much more cheerful look on her face than she did before."""
st01_020#5,"""I didn't want to pry, so I didn't ask her what was going on before...<br>Whatever it is, I'm glad it's resolved."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_104#5,"""Oh, senpai. Hitsugi's... I heard she's been kidnapped."""
st01_020#6,"""I was worried about accidentally pushing her away, so any time she came over I stuck to casual small talk..."""
st01_030#3,"""I should have been more assertive about asking if there was anything she was worried about.<br>...Please get her back soon."""
st01_010#1,"""I'm glad Hitsugi came back safely. She came to see me herself a little while ago."""
st01_020#7,"""We've had all sorts of problems here, but I'm glad you were at least able to save her. She looks more sure of herself, like she's overcome all her self-doubt."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_102#0,"""...Darkers really will show up just about anywhere, won't they?"""
st01_020#8,"""Well, I guess these are technically Phantoms, so it's hard to say whether they're really Darkers."""
st01_030#4,"""Either way, we can't let it slide. As ARKS, it's our main duty to protect everyone from Darkers."""
st01_010#2,"""I heard you've been having a lot of difficulties. And that there was a terrible sacrifice."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_100#2,"""But Aru's coming back, isn't he? Then I'll be here to greet him with a smile."""
st01_010#3,"""The trouble on Earth is over, but given the history of the Photoners, there's probably something similar right around the corner."""
st01_020#9,"""And we still have to do something about the [Profound Darkness]...<br>We've got a lot to think about."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_100#3,"""But you're back with us now, senpai.<br>...It probably sounds weird coming from me, but let's do our best out there."""
sq01_010#0,"""When i heard you'd gone missing, I couldn't believe it at first. I mean, there's no way you'd disappear, right senpai?"""
sq01_020#0,"""But the longer I went without seeing you, the more worried I got..."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_100#4,"""...I'm so glad you're back now. Welcome back, senpai."""
sq02_010#0,"""It probably doesn't mean anything, but this is the first time I've had so few missions since I joined ARKS."""
sq02_020#0,"""It's not like I've had nothing to do, just that I've been feeling a bit underused lately..."""
sq02_030#0,"""I guess if there really is nothing going on, that means we're at peace."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_108#0,"""...I'm sorry, senpai. You were fighting right in front of me, but I couldn't do anything to help you..."""
sq13_020#0,"""No, it wasn't just me...<br>Everyone was overwhelmed. That Goddess of Demise had us all shaking in our shoes."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_105#1,""",,,I've been spending all this time training to fight any opponent...<br>...But there's no way I can begin to fight this one."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_102#1,"""...Oh, senpai. I'm sorry about before. I was feeling really pathetic."""
ep6_sq00_02#0,"""But Xiao contacted me and told me to do what I can. He shook me out of my funk, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5272_104#6,"""So I think the best thing I can do right now is to work hard for...<br>For your sake, senpai."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_105#2,"""...Haha, hey senpai. I feel so pathetic, all I can do is laugh..."""
ep6_sq01_02#0,"""What are we supposed to do when there's no Xiao to give us orders any more..."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_104#7,"""You haven't given up yet, senpai...?<br>You think there's still a chance...?<br>Then I won't give up either...!"""
11_voice_NPC_5272_100#5,"""Senpai! You did it! This is really great news..."""
ep6_sq02_02#0,"""No matter what happens, we should never give up. Thank you for teaching me that, senpai!"""
11_voice_NPC_5272_108#1,"""When Xiao came back, I thought that we'd be back to normal in no time. I guess it wasn't to be."""
ep6_sq02_01_02#0,"""I can't help feeling down. The real battle is all still to come."""
ep6_sq03_02_01_01#0,"""Oh, hey senpai. I've been doing my best to support you."""

text01#0,"""Welcome back, senpai. And thank you very much."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_103#0,"""That last battle... it looked impossible to survive. I mean, she was Shiva, and you're just you. But you came back safe after all. I'm so relieved."""
text03#0,"""You've been working really hard all this time. There's still a few Darkers left, but please get some rest."""
text01#1,"""What is it, senpai? Repaying someone with a Christmas present...?<br>No way... Surely you don't mean me..."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_102#2,"""No, of course not. It's you, after all, you're probably helping someone out. Repaying someone... Let's see..."""
text03#1,"""How about a cute strap to attach to a mobile terminal? It's always nice to get something you can carry around with you."""
text04#0,"""if you buy one for yourself at the same time, then you wear yours at the same time as they wear theirs, maybe it'll bring you closer together..."""
text05#0,"""Ahh! F-forget about that last part, senpai! M-M-Merry Christmas!"""
