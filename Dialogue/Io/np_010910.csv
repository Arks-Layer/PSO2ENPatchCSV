Io_favs_after_030#0,"""Look, I'm giving it to you. It's fine, just take it.<br>...See you around, senpai."""

Alice_01_10#0,"""Hm? What is it, senpai? You look like you want something."""
Alice_01_20#0,"""If you have a question for me, I'll do my best to answer it."""
Alice_01_30#0,"""What did you say? Could I see myself in an interracial relationship?<br>...What exactly are you trying to ask me, senpai?"""
Alice_01_40#0,"""Hmm, I think you're up to something, senpai. You've got some ulterior motive. Fine, I'll give you an answer."""
Alice_01_50#0,"""I guess... I wouldn't mind being with someone of another race."""
Alice_01_60#0,"""I mean, I'm a Dewman, after all. There aren't exactly many like me to choose from in the first place."""
Alice_01_70#0,"""Besides, if I fell in love with someone, I like to think their race or their appearance wouldn't matter..."""
Alice_01_80#0,"""...Ahh, what the heck am I saying?! Senpai, forget everything you just heard! This didn't happen! Oh, this is so embarrassing..."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#1,"""Hey, senpai... Huh? You have a question for me? Sure, if it'll help you out. Ask away."""
Auyuku_01_020#0,"""Huh? You want me to tell you what I do to stay on good terms with so many people...?"""
Auyuku_01_030#0,"""I'm not that good at socializing. Although, for some reason, people keep asking me to help them promote their class..."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#0,"""...Ughhh...!<br>Sorry, senpai. Just remembering it made me cringe...!"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_105#0,"""Huh...? You think it's because I listen to people and take them seriously, so I seem reliable? Well, if you say so, I guess that must be it."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#1,"""There aren't many other Dewmans around here, huh? Are they all out on missions?"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_105#1,"""There's a lot of tall people around, so my neck gets tired from looking up all the time."""
Npc91_mb02_020#0,"""I wish I could be just a little taller...<br>Oh, well."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#2,"""I don't mind being a Dewman, but sometimes I catch people staring at me."""
Npc91_mb03_020#0,"""Maybe it would be better if I hid my horns with a hat for the time being."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#3,"""My hat? Oh, I stopped wearing that pretty quickly. I realized I actually prefer standing out."""
Npc91_mb04_020#0,"""It's good to get noticed, even if it means people look at me funny.<br>...It is a little embarrassing, though."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#2,"""...The other day, a stranger approached me, and we got into a long conversation about fashion. She was really beautiful."""
Npc91_mb05_020#0,"""She didn't seem at all worried about looking weird.<br>...Maybe I'm too self-conscious."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#3,"""Watching the way strong people fight can be very helpful. it's fun to figure out their moves little by little."""
Npc91_mb06_020#0,"""When I think about how they used to be like me, and how much they've improved since then, it motivates me to keep training myself."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#4,"""I don't expect to get very strong. I just don't want to stay weak."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#4,"""There's a nasty feeling in the air. Even I can tell."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_106#0,"""So... that was Dark Falz? It was way more powerful than I expected."""
Npc91_mb09_020#0,"""Could you imagine if it had been at full power? We wouldn't have stood a chance."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#5,"""That berserk dragon is a hot topic right now, but I've never seen it, so I don't have anything to tell you."""
Npc91_mb10_020#0,"""If it's berserk, does that mean it attacks everything around it, no matter where it goes?"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#6,"""A Battle Championship? I'm not really interested. I'll stick to the sidelines."""
Npc91_mb11_020#0,"""I don't really like getting too much attention."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#5,"""We Dewmans are a little weak defensively, so we have an easier time if we're in a party."""
Npc91_mb12_020#0,"""...I usually work solo, though, so it's not a hard and fast rule."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#6,"""Why do I fight alone? Because it's easier that way."""
Npc91_mb13_020#0,"""It's not that I hate other people. I'll work with them if I have to, and I'm not afraid to talk to people."""
Npc91_mb13_030#0,"""It's just that I tend to talk to myself.<br>...It's kind of embarrassing."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#7,"""I often see you talking with all kinds of people, senpai. You have a lot of friends in ARKS, don't you?"""
Npc91_mb14_020#0,"""I'm more comfortable on my own, but it can get a bit lonely.<br>...I'm a little jealous."""
Npc91_mb14_030#0,"""...What's up with that expression? You think I'm weird, don't you? Oh, no, I knew this would happen!"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#8,"""Would I like to talk to other ARKS more? No, I'm alright as I am now. That's not really my kind of thing."""
Npc91_mb15_020#0,"""I didn't join ARKS to make friends. I prefer to keep myself to myself."""
Npc91_mb15_030#0,"""Besides, I have you to talk to, senpai."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_105#2,"""...I've got a bad feeling about this. I can't say what it is exactly, but I'm feeling really uncomfortable."""
Npc91_mb16_020#0,"""...You seem alright though, senpai. You aren't gonna go  disappearing on me all of a sudden, are you??"""
Npc91_mb16_030#0,"""Being able to talk to you has been really helpful. If I lost you...<br>Things would get a lot harder for me."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#7,"""...Oh! Senpai, you're safe! Thank goodness..."""
Npc91_mb16zeno_020#0,"""Haha...<br>I'm so relieved, I'm actually feeling a bit faint. I don't know what to say."""
Npc91_mb16zeno_030#0,"""Senpai... thank you so much. Being able to see you again, to talk to you like this...<br>It makes me so happy."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_106#1,"""The mood in ARKS has changed a surprising amount recently. You think so too, right, senpai?"""
Npc91_mb18_020#0,"""It feels like they've been more transparent when they communicate with us, right? I'm usually alone, so I pick up on these things."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#8,"""Is it because of what you did six months ago?<br>...I think I like it better this way."""
Npc91_mb19_010#0,"""Recently, I've been talking to more people aside from you."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#9,"""I'm still not very good at talking to people, but...<br>I don't think it's been going too badly."""
Npc91_mb19_030#0,"""But talking to you is easier. I feel like I can speak more freely. So, come talk to me any time you like."""
Npc91_mb20_010#0,"""Hey, senpai. If you've got a minute, want to hang out and talk?"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#9,"""...N-no, I didn't have anything in mind. There's nothing to worry about, I just wanted to talk to you."""
Npc91_mb20_030#0,"""You don't have to treat me like a little kid. I'm fine, really."""
Npc91_mb21_010#0,"""Yo, senpai. Huh? You're wondering why I'm not hanging out with Patty and Tia today?"""
Npc91_mb21_020#0,"""You saw what happened last time. Why would you even have to ask me that?"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_106#2,"""Ahh... Just thinking about it is embarrassing...<br>Senpai, please just forget that ever happened..."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#10,"""Whew... O-oh, it's you, senpai. Why was I sighing? Haha, it's nothing."""
Npc91_mb22_020#0,"""It's the first time I've had to myself for a while, so I was just trying to relax myself. That's all."""
Npc91_mb22_030#0,"""There really is nothing to worry about, I'm fine. Thanks for your concern, though."""
Npc91_mb23_010#0,"""Say, where's Matoi? Are you on your own? That's rare these days."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#11,"""Ah, sorry, it's nothing. It's just, I see you two together so much, when you aren't it makes me wonder if something's happened."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#10,"""Haha, there I go, worrying about nothing. Everyone winds up alone from time to time, right? I shouldn't let it bother me."""
Npc91_mb23_after_010#0,"""...Why did things have to turn out this way?"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#12,"""If only I'd been there, maybe I could have done something..."""
Npc91_mb23_after_030#0,"""All I can do now is wish I had as much power as you do, senpai."""
Npc91_mb24_010#0,"""There's a lot of things I want to say to Matoi when she comes back."""
Npc91_mb24_020#0,"""I was really sad when I heard she'd disappeared. It felt like... like I might never be happy again."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#11,"""So, senpai...<br>It might sound strange coming from me, but I'll ask you anyway. Please bring Matoi back home."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#12,"""Hey, senpai! Thank goodness...<br>I was hoping I'd run into you."""
Npc91_mb24_after_020#0,"""This probably sounds strange coming from me, but... thank you. Thank you for bringing Matoi back."""
Npc91_mb24_after_030#0,"""I was really glad to see her again. Thank you so, so much."""
Npc91_mb25_010#0,"""You throw yourself into every issue around, don't you, senpai?"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_102#0,"""Now you're getting involved with the Lillipans too."""
Npc91_mb25_030#0,"""I get that you're the type of person who likes to help out, but...<br>You should really pace yourself."""
Stratos_01_010#0,"""Huh?! Valentine's worries?!<br>...Well, I guess if you really want to hear it..."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#13,"""There is something that's been stumping me. I don't get how you're supposed to give people chocolate."""
Stratos_01_030#0,"""It's better to wear something cute when you're offering it, right? So maybe I should wear...<br>No, no, I'm fine as I am!"""
text01#0,"""What is it, senpai? Repaying someone with a Christmas present...?<br>No way... Surely you don't mean me..."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_102#1,"""No, of course not. It's you, after all, you're probably helping someone out. Repaying someone... Let's see..."""
text03#0,"""How about a cute strap to attach to a mobile terminal? It's always nice to get something you can carry around with you."""
text04#0,"""if you buy one for yourself at the same time, then you wear yours at the same time as they wear theirs, maybe it'll bring you closer together..."""
text05#0,"""Ahh! F-forget about that last part, senpai! M-M-Merry Christmas!"""
