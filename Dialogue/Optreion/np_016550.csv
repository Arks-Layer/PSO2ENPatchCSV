text02#0,"""Ignis has my Partner Card. If you want it, get it from her."""
11_voice_NPC_5655_104#0,"""Ignis is our captain on this mission. But... I haven't spoken to her much yet, so I don't understand the way she thinks."""
text01#1,"""Any mission where I can help ARKS who're in trouble is ideal for me!"""
11_voice_NPC_5655_901#0,"""Everyone has their own reasons for doing this, but for me, it doesn't matter what the reason is as long as I get to help people!"""
text03#0,"""Leader, call me whenever you're in trouble! I'll come running right away!"""
text01#2,"""You're pretty fashionable, aren't you Leader? You've got a good sense for how to coordinate your outfit with your weapon."""
11_voice_NPC_5655_101#0,"""It's important to pay attention to your appearance! A Warrior of Hope has to look cool, after all!!"""
text01#3,"""Warrior of Hope, Optreion is here! Yeah, that's a perfect way to announce my name!!"""
11_voice_NPC_5655_101#1,"""Let's go! For the sake of all those in need!"""
text01#4,"""Oh, sounds like we can take a break from our mission. I'm glad I was able to be useful to you!"""
11_voice_NPC_5655_101#2,"""But what I was most happy about was that everyone ate the delicious rice I cooked!"""
text03#1,"""Every single one asked for seconds! Seeing them all eat up so heartily makes me want to make it again."""
text04#0,"""You should eat with us next time, Leader. I'll make your favorite meal for you!!"""
11_voice_NPC_5655_901#1,"""I'll be waiting! Of course, you can give me a call any time someone needs help as well!"""
