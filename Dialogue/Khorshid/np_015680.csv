11_voice_NPC_5568_202#0,"""Ah, Leader. How are you doing?<br>...What's wrong? You have an odd look on your face. Is there something strange about my appearance?"""
11_voice_NPC_5499_204#0,"""Hehe, it feels weird to have Khorshid here on the ARKS Ship, doesn't it?"""
text01003#0,"""It's just as weird for me. It's not so long ago that I wouldn't have dreamed of spending any time in a place like this..."""
text01004#0,"""If I hadn't met you and Gene, I would never have even heard of ARKS, or known all the things you do."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_205#0,"""I had something to ask you, but...<br>It can wait. Speak to me whenever you're ready to hear it."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_101#0,"""You ARKS have a lot of customs with no parallels in Erzimarut culture. Very interesting."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_202#1,"""Akhtar came here before? Hmm...<br>I can't see any sign of her anywhere."""
text03001#0,"""You ARKS have all sorts of clothes. Look at that woman there. Her outfit is both fashionable and cute."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_104#0,"""That could look good on Akhtar.<br>She's worn the same clothes ever since she became a Darknix."""
text03003#0,"""I think it would look good on you too, Khorshid. Oh... maybe it would be a little tight around the chest..."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_106#0,"""You're one to talk, Gene. Honestly. Perhaps I'd be able to wear clothes like yours, then."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_104#1,"""I wanted to go on a mission, if possible... But when I transform, I spread Darker Factor around me."""
text04002#0,"""If I transformed, I might be mistaken for a hostile.<br>...I want to avoid looking suspicious."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_204#0,"""...Still, being cooped up and unable to fight is grating. I hate having to ask for your help.."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_205#1,"""I think there are more ARKS starting conversations with me than there were before."""
text05002#0,"""It used to be that they didn't dare approach me. Perhaps dealing with my stress has made me less tense."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_201#0,"""All thanks to you and Gene. It's important that cultural exchanges like this are fun. Heheh, thank you, Leader."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_205#2,"""It's been a long time, Leader. You're looking well."""
text02#0,"""My sister, Akhtar, and I have come to visit the ARKS Ship together. I hate to impose on you, but please take care of us both."""
text03#0,"""Akhtar's been missing you, you know. Be sure to stop by and talk to her."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_205#3,"""There are very few visible differences between the Darknix bodies we use for battle and the living bodies we use for everyday life."""
text02#1,"""Of course, an Erzimarut would pick up on those differences right away...<br>What about you ARKS?"""
11_voice_NPC_5568_203#0,"""Well, Leader? Which body do you think I'm using right now?"""
11_voice_NPC_5568_104#2,"""Hey, Leader. Do you think Akhtar's face has got a little rounder lately?"""
11_voice_NPC_5568_100#0,"""...Really? I'm sure she's been eating more ever since she got here."""
text03#1,"""I'll have to take her down to the training room to burn off some of that fat later."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_204#1,"""Phew, desk work makes my shoulders ache."""
text02#2,"""I'll have to ask Akhtar for a shoulder massage later.<br>...You wouldn't happen to know how to give a shoulder massage, would you?"""
text01#0,"""The number of ARKS coming to help us with our reconstruction work has greatly increased lately."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_201#1,"""It's all thanks to you and Gene offering to help. We're deeply indebted to you."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_202#2,"""The reconstruction still has a long way to go, but...<br>With you on our side, all my worries are assuaged. We're counting on you, Leader."""
