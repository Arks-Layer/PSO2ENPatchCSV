text03#0,"""This is from me. I wrote it with the quill pen that I made from the feathers that you brought me."""
11_voice_NPC_5646_100#0,"""It is a \""Relief Ticket\"". When I was a child, I would give one to my brother when he grew weary from the business of public affairs. It made him very happy."""
11_voice_NPC_5647_100#0,"""And from me... ta-da! It's my home-made omurice! Can you read the words I wrote on it in ketchup?"""
11_voice_NPC_5647_107#0,"""Yep, that's it! It says \""I love you<white><pict cute_icon><c>\""...<br>No, wait, that's not it! Who told you about that?!"""
11_voice_NPC_5647_103#0,"""I did try to write that at first, but it got too embarrassing, so I gave up...<br>Umm, the correct answer is \""Thank you for your hard work<white><pict cute_icon><c>\""!"""
