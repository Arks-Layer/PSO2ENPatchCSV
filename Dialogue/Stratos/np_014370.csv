Oku_01_030#0,"""Huh?<br>You're just doing a survey about Valentines gift giving, you say? Of... of course you are! J-jeez, how silly of me!"""
11_voice_NPC_5437_105#0,"""Ahem, right, well. If it was me... I'd give out something edible like chocolate. Eating food gives energy!"""

Hyui_01_020#0,"""You'd like me to look at this battle record and give my opinion as a learner...?<br>Of course, if that's what you want."""
11_voice_NPC_5437_101#0,"""How to defeat a weakened enemy? I see, it's a good summary and easy to understand!"""
Hyui_01_040#0,"""I was wondering what the best way to learn enemies' weaknesses would be. Did you know that somehow...?"""

11_voice_NPC_5437_109#0,"""...I couldn't stop them. If the Commander hadn't issued the order to retreat, I would have been a sitting duck..."""
ep6_sq01_02#0,"""...I deserve to be disqualified as a Hero. I'm supposed to help people, but I couldn't protect anyone when it really counted..."""

11_voice_NPC_5437_102#3,"""Aw, why are you being such a meanie? I guess you don't want a present, then?"""
11_voice_NPC_5566_100#0,"""Heheheh, let's not be hasty now...<br>If you have no other way to express your gratitude, I suppose I'll accept it.<br>That... is my \""gift\"" to you."""

ep6_sq03_03_03#0,"""I was so embarrassed! I'm never going to wear it again... Not even if you ask me to!"""
ep6_sq03_04_01#0,"""This is great... Fantastic! The three of us are finally back together, just like in the old days...<br>I wish I'd been braver, though..."""
ep6_sq03_04_02#0,"""I was scared...<br>I was afraid that if I started asking Luco questions, she'd leave us again."""
11_voice_NPC_5437_100#5,"""I really appreciate you and Kyo making me see sense! Thank you very much!"""
Kyokuya_01_010#0,"""Hiya! It's about Kyo, is it? He might act all tough now, but when we were kids he was a lot nicer!"""
11_voice_NPC_5437_100#6,"""I was always scared of the way my teacher looked when he got angry. One time he made me cry, and Kyo marched right up to him and said \""The reason she's having trouble in class is cause of your ugly face!\"""""
Kyokuya_01_030#0,"""He was always so honest and open about his feelings back then... Oh, keep that story to yourself, got it?"""
Kyokuya_01_040#0,"""Anyway, deep down Kyo's the same nice, kind guy he used to be. You can take my word on that as his childhood friend!"""
11_voice_NPC_5437_106#2,"""Hello! What's up?<br>Huh? Something for me from Kyo? Repaying the chocolate I gave him..."""
Kyokuya_01_020#0,"""But he just...<br>That's funny, why would Kyo give me two...?"""
Kyokuya_01_030#1,"""The thing is, Kyo gave me a chestnut cookie himself a little while ago as a thank-you! Hehe..."""
Kyokuya_01_040#1,"""I'm so glad I gave him that chocolate!<br>At least, that's what I thought, but it feels a bit greedy to get two cookies in return..."""
11_voice_NPC_5437_100#7,"""Oh well, guess I've got no choice! Sure, I'll take it! Thank you very much!"""
Stratos_01_010#0,"""Xiera here! Sorry for interrupting! It looks like we were right about who embodied that Phantom."""
Stratos_01_020#0,"""Valentine's ability? I don't know what that means, but it seems like her strong desire to help those in need is what was embodied."""
Stratos_01_030#0,"""But it's not like the real Stratos to worry about things like that...<br>She's more the type to charge ahead without fear..."""
Stratos_01_040#0,"""Could something from her past be holding her back? Still, we don't want to pry if it's not something she feels comfortable talking about."""
Stratos_01_050#0,"""I want to collect more data on this Phantom. I'm sorry, but I need to ask you to keep on helping. Thanks!"""
name01#0,"""Xiera"""
Stratos_01_010#1,"""Hi, what's up?<br>You're listening to people's worries about Valentine's Day?"""
11_voice_NPC_5437_101#3,"""That's weird! I was just thinking that I wanted to help people who don't know what to do about Valentine's!"""
Stratos_01_030#1,"""But, well... I don't exactly have much experience with Valentine's Day myself..."""
Stratos_01_040#1,"""I really want to help, but I don't have the ability... I guess that's my Valentine's worry. Ahaha..."""
Stratos_01_010#2,"""Oh, <%me>...<br>Keep your voice down, I don't want Kyo to hear us..."""
Stratos_01_020#1,"""...Yeah, it's just what it looks like. I made this chocolate to give to Kyo..."""
Stratos_01_030#2,"""Actually, I tried to give him chocolate when we were kids... He said it was \""boring\"" and wouldn't take it."""
11_voice_NPC_5437_104#3,"""I didn't mean to upset him. Maybe he felt embarrassed because I tried to give it to him in front of everyone."""
Stratos_01_050#1,"""But I don't want him to turn it down again... Hey, is that fruit in your hand for me?"""
Stratos_01_060#0,"""...Am I giving up now? Yeah, I am. After all, my chocolate's boring, isn't it? Huh? It's not?"""
Stratos_01_070#0,"""Kyo probably regrets refusing it before? So I should offer the chocolate I made to him again...?"""
Stratos_01_080#0,"""...I understand. I'll trust in Kyo, and in you... I'll find my courage and give my chocolate away!"""
Stratos_01_090#0,"""Oh, and take this! It's a little different from Kyo's, but... It's chocolate for you from me!"""

oct02#0,"""...You want to know how to become powerful? Well, ideally you should train every day, but more importantly, you have to have some kind of role model to follow."""
11_voice_NPC_5664_104#0,"""...A role model, huh? I can't think of anyone like that."""
oct04#0,"""Really? The whole reason I became an ARKS in the first place was that there was someone I wanted to be like!"""
11_voice_NPC_5437_100#9,"""That person was my hero, so I want to be a hero to someone else. That's what I mean by my role model."""
oct06#0,"""But it's going to be different for each person. If you can't think of anyone you admire, maybe there's someone you want to beat?"""
