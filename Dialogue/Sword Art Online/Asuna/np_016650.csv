text01#0,"""Hello, <%me>.<br>I should formally introduce myself."""
text02#0,"""My name is Asuna. I'm Kirito's adventuring partner."""
11_voice_NPC_5665_100#0,"""I hope we can be friends."""
text01#1,"""This outfit brings back a lot of memories. I was wearing it when I first got to know Kirito."""
text02#1,"""Back then, I was known as the sub-leader of the Knights of the Blood...<br>I felt like if I wasn't strong enough...<br>Any day could have been my last."""
11_voice_NPC_5665_100#1,"""Kirito and I weren't nearly as close back then as we are now. Hehe, now that I think about it, I used to be very stubborn."""
text04#0,"""There are lots of memories, both good and bad, tied up with this outfit. I'm glad to have a chance to wear it again!"""
text01#2,"""From what I've heard, you can fish on each of the different planets, is that right? I wonder what you can catch."""
text02#2,"""That reminds me of the time Kirito caught the King of Lakes. How nostalgic~"""
text03#0,"""Is there anything as big as that that we could catch here?"""
11_voice_NPC_5665_101#0,"""There's such a rich variety of fashion and room items here! I love it!"""
text02#3,"""There's so many cute ones that I want to buy! What is it you use here, Meseta?"""
text03#1,"""Window shopping is fun no matter what world you're in."""
text01#3,"""In the world we originally came from, ALO... we have a lot of friends,"""
text02#4,"""We've known them for a long time...<br>We're as close as close can be."""
text03#2,"""They'll be so lonely without us if we don't go back soon. And so will we. But, still..."""
text04#1,"""Each first meeting between two people is a miracle. There's someone very special to me who taught me how important that is..."""
text05#0,"""So, for now, let's enjoy our time together. I'd love to be able to invite you to ALO some day. I'm sure you'd love it!"""
