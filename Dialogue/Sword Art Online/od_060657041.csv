11_voice_NPC_5665_100#0,"""Matoi's told me all about the many dishes Oracle has, and I'd really like to try cooking one of them."""
text03#0,"""Despite how I might appear, I'm actually pretty good at cooking. Could you teach me a recipe?"""
11_voice_NPC_5665_104#0,"""Matoi said her favourite was Seafood Brochette. I'm curious, how do you make it?"""
text05#0,"""Huh? You think I should try eating it before you give me the recipe?"""
text06#0,"""Good thinking. You can't just blindly stumble through a recipe without knowing what you should be getting. In that case, could you bring me one?"""
