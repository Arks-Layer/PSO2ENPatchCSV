text01#0,"""<%me>, you came!<br>Guess I should introduce myself properly."""
text02#0,"""I'm Kirito. I'm still getting used to all this, so I'll probably need your help. Nice to meet you!"""
text01#1,"""My clothes? Yeah, I guess you don't see many people dressed like this around here."""
text02#1,"""Bright colors don't really suit me...<br>I guess without realizing it, I picked equipment that reflects that."""
11_voice_NPC_5664_100#0,"""Back in the day, this coat got me known as the 《Black Swordsman》."""
text04#0,"""If I find anything that looks good here, I might give it a try."""
text01#2,"""Every time we see you two, you're surrounded by other ARKS. You Guardians must be really popular."""
11_voice_NPC_5664_106#0,"""You've saved the world several times over...?"""
text03#0,"""Now I get it. You guys are heroes around here. You'll have to tell me the whole story some time."""
text01#3,"""I don't know how you knew, but yeah, I wanted to talk some more."""
text02#2,"""The world Asuna and I come from is a little bit different from this one."""
text03#1,"""Oh, but don't worry, it's not like we can't go back there or anything."""
text04#1,"""While we're here, we want to do our bit as ARKS."""
text05#0,"""Since you're the more experienced one, I'd appreciate anything you can tell me. I'm in your hands."""
text01#4,"""This Oracle place...<br>I thought we came here by chance, but it feels more like it might have been fate."""
text02#3,"""Each of these ARKS is striving for something, and going through hard times in pursuit of it."""
text03#2,"""It's the same old story, no matter what world we find ourselves in."""
text04#2,"""We have to go back to the world we came from soon, but we'll never forget this one. Or you, or Matoi."""
text05#1,"""...Well, there's still some places I want to go and things I want to do. Will you go with me, Guardian?"""
