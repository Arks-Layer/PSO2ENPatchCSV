11_voice_NPC_5654_104#0,"""Oh... you need my card before I can go with you."""
text03#0,"""Ignis has my Partner Card. Could you ask her to give it to you?"""
text01#1,"""Seraphy told me that this is a public relations mission to raise awareness of Weaponoids."""
11_voice_NPC_5654_104#1,"""Everyone else seems to think our mission is something different...<br>Hmm... What could it mean?"""
text03#1,"""Still, any chance to go on missions with my Master will be good for my training! I hope I'll be useful to you!"""
text01#2,"""Master, you're already so strong, but you never seem satisfied. You're always aiming for greater heights."""
11_voice_NPC_5654_101#0,"""Not just with training, but improving the power of your weapons as well...<br>I really respect that about you!!"""
text01#3,"""Ah! Master, are you going out on a mission? P-please wait a minute! I'm not fully prepared yet..."""
11_voice_NPC_5654_105#0,"""I want to fight with you, Master! I need to see all your moves so I can learn them for myself!!"""
text01#4,"""Oh, Master! Thank you for all your hard work! Seraphy told us that we can take a break from our mission."""

11_voice_NPC_5654_903#0,"""As expected of Seraphy! She must have chosen us carefully to make up for each other's weaknesses!"""
11_voice_NPC_5654_100#0,"""And when I talked to them...<br>They turned out to be surprisingly interesting people. Thanks to you, Master, we became good friends."""
11_voice_NPC_5654_901#0,"""I greatly respect your ability to bring people together, Master!<br>I, Kazami-no-tachi, swear to continue to learn everything I can from you!"""
