Risa_mb19_010#0,"""The Floating Facility of Wopal?<br>Lisa doesn't go there. It's kind of boring."""

11_voice_NPC_5026_100#7,"""Lisa would much rather go to a place where she could<br>light the area up without worrying about it, you know?<br>Hehe. Hehehehe."""
Risa_mb20_010#0,"""Everyone's so fixated on Harkotan and [Double], you know?<br>Lisa... not so much."""
Risa_mb20_020#0,"""There's got to be a WAY stranger enemy<br>or a WAY creepier place, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#8,"""That right there is what's really been on Lisa's mind.<br>So, what about you?"""
Risa_mb21_010#0,"""Lisa thinks the Corrupted Areas are way more<br>interesting than Dark Falz."""
Risa_mb21_020#0,"""They are areas with REALLY strong enemies;<br>perfect places to unload your entire arsenal<br>and then some, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#9,"""Hehe. Sounds fun, right?<br>Lisa's just happy she has a place where she can shoot<br>and shoot and shoot and shoot, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#10,"""[Double]... [Apprentice]...<br>The problems just keep piling up, you know?"""
Risa_mb22_020#0,"""Well, it's a Darker, so Lisa will just enjoy shooting it<br>LOTS and LOTS of times, you know?"""

Risa_mb23_010#0,"""Oh, hello hello!<br>That was pretty intense, you know?<br>It's good you weren't hurt too bad."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#11,"""Well actually, if you ask Lisa,<br>being eaten by Dark Falz is<br>kind of an honour, you know?"""
Risa_mb23_030#0,"""Because it means you must have killed lots and lots of enemies.<br>Lisa's actually kind of jealous, you know?"""

Risa_mb24_020#0,"""So many enemies...<br>Lisa's going full tilt for this, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#13,"""Hehehe. Hehe.<br>Lisa can hardly wait anymore. She really wants to<br>shoot some enemies, you know?"""

st01_020#0,"""Oh, but but but... what a beautiful way of<br>sleeping, you know?"""
st01_030#0,"""So how was it? Cold sleep, that is. Lisa thinks<br>it must have gone by in a split second."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_106#2,"""My my, Lisa is so very jealous!<br>You've gotten mixed up in something<br>quite spectacular, you know?"""
st01_020#1,"""Please let Lisa in on that! There's probably lots of things<br>to shoot and shoot and shoot<br>and KILL, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#16,"""Oh. Where would Lisa be stationed?<br>Hehehe. Lisa probably shouldn't even bother asking, should she?"""
st01_020#2,"""What Lisa's REALLY interested in is<br>that group that came from Earth!<br>Lisa wants to try shooting them. Hehehe."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#17,"""Lisa wonders what it would feel like<br>to shoot them, you know?<br>Hehehehe. That's what's been on Lisa's mind."""
st01_020#3,"""Oh, don't look at Lisa like that! It's okay!<br>Lisa only shoots when authorized."""
st01_030#1,"""But! If Lisa WAS authorized,<br>she'd definitely want to try shooting them.<br>It would probably feel wonderful!"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#18,"""Lisa's actually found explosives to be<br>quite wonderful lately, you know?"""
st01_020#4,"""Of course, nothing tops driving bullets into skulls,<br>but there's something quite charming about<br>deconstructing someone on a molecular level."""
st01_030#2,"""Oh yes, Lisa's definitely wants to try it.<br>If you find anyone who looks like they'd<br>blow up nicely, please do give Lisa a call!"""
st01_010#0,"""Anyone who treats ARKS with hostility must be met with hostility in kind.<br>That's what Lisa thinks!"""
st01_020#5,"""When one side thinks that they are right and everyone else is wrong,<br>the fight's already begun.<br>No point in holding back, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#19,"""That's when Lisa starts thinking about who would feel the best to shoot.<br>Hehe. Hehehehe."""
st01_010#1,"""Lisa was on the Ship when it was attacked, but she wasn't<br>allowed to go to where all the fighting was."""
st01_020#6,"""The enemies were right here, you know?!<br>It was the perfect time for a fight!<br>What a letdown."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#20,"""Who cares if the martial law limiters weren't released?<br>If Lisa can't shoot her guns, then she'll just start punching!<br>Hehehehe."""
st01_010#2,"""Hmm. Hmm! So... Phantoms are a new species<br>that took on the form of Darkers?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_106#3,"""While that sounds like it'd be hard to tell<br>which is Darker and which is Phantom,<br>it's actually quite easy."""
11_voice_NPC_5026_100#21,"""You can tell by shooting them!<br>Each one feels different to shoot at, you know?<br>Hehehe."""
st01_010#3,"""Evolution is quite interesting.<br>But how exactly does evolution<br>take place, you know?"""
st01_020#7,"""Is it based on what one wants?<br>Or maybe what one doesn't want?<br>That's just selfish, you know?"""
st01_030#3,"""Lisa's thinking too much.<br>Lisa likes doing fun things instead of<br>thinking about confusing things."""

sq00_020#0,"""Oh, Lisa's just worried about something.<br>Don't worry, it doesn't have anything to do with you."""

sq02_020#0,"""You wouldn't happen to know of anything that might soon<br>deserve to be shot, would you?"""
11_voice_NPC_5026_107#2,"""Hmm? HMMM? Oh my my my!<br>You're on your way to go kill something,<br>aren't you?"""
sq04_020#0,"""Lisa can tell, you know?<br>You have a peculiar look about you."""
sq04_030#0,"""So what are you doing?<br>Is it going to be really dangerous?"""
sq04_040#0,"""Well, it probably has nothing to do with Lisa.<br>Hmmm. Or... perhaps it does, you know?"""
