text02#0,"""...You're not a gawper? You heard there was trouble and came to see what you could do...?<br>What you mean is, you're here to help."""
11_voice_NPC_5668_106#0,"""...Fulfilling our wishes will make this troublesome situation go away...?<br>I find that hard to believe..."""
11_voice_NPC_5670_100#0,"""Well, your timing's pretty convenient! We're all still trying to remember who we are and what we're doing here!"""
text05#0,"""For myself... All I remember is that my name is Shiva, and that I'm in some kind of trouble. So, can you help me?"""
text01#0,"""Hmhmhmm, hmhmhmm..."""
11_voice_NPC_5669_102#0,"""Gh... How long have you been here? With all these people passing by singing to themselves, I almost got drawn into it myself."""

11_voice_NPC_5669_104#1,"""Does this event have some special power?"""
11_voice_NPC_5669_101#0,"""I was rather surprised when you presented that sea snail to me. Honestly, that such a thing would make me laugh is quite absurd."""
text02#1,"""And yet... When was the last time I laughed like that? I cannot remember. But what I do know is this..."""
text03#2,"""Having spent such a lively event with you...<br>I am certain I will never forget it."""
