11_voice_NPC_5670_104#0,"""Hmm. Can't put my finger on what, but there's just something about your face. Makes me think of you as my comrade."""
text02#0,"""Wonder what kind of comrade...<br>Ah well, it'll do for now. How do you like it, comrade?"""
text01#0,"""Don't know why, but every time a guy comes past here and sees me with Mother and Shiva, he gives me this absolutely filthy look."""
11_voice_NPC_5670_108#0,"""And the way they're muttering, something's going to boil over soon. You'd better get this sorted out soon."""
text01#1,"""By the way, comrade, what part do you want me to play at this party?"""
11_voice_NPC_5670_100#0,"""\""Entertainment\""...? Ah, you mean you want me to be a clown, don't you? Ahaha, that kinda feels like it fits.<br>...But what do clowns have to do with Christmas?"""
11_voice_NPC_5670_104#1,"""Hey. Give it to me straight. Was I really in trouble?"""
text02#1,"""So it's true. I really was in trouble. And you turned up to help at the last minute."""
11_voice_NPC_5670_100#1,"""Bravo, comrade, well done. And you did it all for little old me. What fun this has been, comrade!"""
