text01#0,"""<%me>, Xiera here!<br>I've been analyzing that Stratos that appeared in the Shop Area from here."""
text02#0,"""According to my analysis, she's a Phantom. A harmless, non-hostile Phantom."""
text03#0,"""As I'm sure you remember, Phantoms are creatures created when Ether reacts to someone's emotions."""
text04#0,"""Since she's so focused on people enjoying Valentine's Day, it's likely that the real Stratos's feelings are what were embodied..."""
text05#0,"""In any case, if we can deal with the Phantom's feelings, we should be able to resolve this situation. I'd appreciate your help with this!"""
