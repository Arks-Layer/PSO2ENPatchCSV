ssc_501100_0010#0,"""Hm? Oh, <%me>!"""
ssc_501100_0020#0,"""Why're you all the way out here?"""
ssc_501100_0030#0,"""Taking a break?"""
ssc_501100_0040#0,"""Just resting for a bit."""
ssc_501100_0050#0,"""Yeah. This is a really<br>nice spot for a rest."""
ssc_501100_0060#0,"""...Stia really is a crazy place, isn't it?"""
ssc_501100_0070#0,"""All jagged and rocky, with<br>barely any grass or trees growing."""
ssc_501100_0080#0,"""Not to mention all the DOLLS."""
ssc_501100_0090#0,"""I don't think the old me<br>would've lasted a day out here."""
ssc_501100_0100#0,"""But somehow, I managed to fight<br>my way this far with you and Manon."""
ssc_501100_0110#0,"""Do you think this means that<br>I've... gotten a bit stronger?"""
ssc_501100_0120#0,"""You definitely have."""
ssc_501100_0130#0,"""You still have to try harder."""
ssc_501100_0140#0,"""Really? I'm so happy to hear<br>that coming from you."""
ssc_501100_0150#0,"""Hmph. I can't really argue<br>when I hear it from you..."""
ssc_501100_0160#0,"""You know, I've been reading<br>more of Manon's daily logs lately."""
ssc_501100_0170#0,"""Particularly the parts where<br>she writes about all the enemies."""
ssc_501100_0180#0,"""About how all the enemies move, and<br>which of those movements leave them open to attack..."""
ssc_501100_0190#0,"""Before, I just read her logs out of<br>curiosity, and I only kinda understood them..."""
ssc_501100_0200#0,"""But now, I make sure to memorize them,<br>so I can make use of that info in real fights."""
ssc_501100_0210#0,"""It's helped me gradually get a hang<br>of things over time. You know..."""
ssc_501100_0220#0,"""I'll be fighting, and think like,<br>\""Oh, Manon would do that move right now\""..."""
ssc_501100_0230#0,"""Or like, \""What would Manon do<br>to turn the tables here?\"" and stuff."""
ssc_501100_0240#0,"""And then, eventually I started thinking<br>\""What would I do to turn the tables right here?\"""""
ssc_501100_0250#0,"""Little by little, I think I'm actually<br>starting to develop my own fighting style."""
ssc_501100_0260#0,"""Learn the basics, and then go from there."""
ssc_501100_0270#0,"""Innovation starts with imitation."""
ssc_501100_0280#0,"""Yeah. I've been trying out a<br>bunch of different ways to fight."""
ssc_501100_0290#0,"""I've learned that there isn't<br>just one right way to go about it."""
ssc_501100_0300#0,"""Ah, that! My Dad<br>used to say that too!"""
ssc_501100_0310#0,"""Oh, I see... So this is<br>what he was talking about."""
ssc_501100_0320#0,"""I finally get it now."""
ssc_501100_0330#0,"""...Manon's helped me out so much,<br>so I want to return the favor to her one day."""
ssc_501100_0340#0,"""And to you as well, of course."""
ssc_501100_0350#0,"""So that's why I've gotta keep trying hard,<br>so I can catch up to both of you..."""
ssc_501100_0360#0,"""Alright! Break time's over!"""
ssc_501100_0370#0,"""I just thought of some new ways<br>to fight, so I'm gonna go try 'em out."""
ssc_501100_0380#0,"""See you later!"""
