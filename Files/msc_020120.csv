msc_020120_0020#0,"""Hey! <%me>! This is bad...<br>You have to help!"""
msc_020120_0030#0,"""What's wrong?"""
msc_020120_0040#0,"""Calm down."""
msc_020120_0050#0,"""Okay... umm."""
msc_020120_0060#0,"""Ah, right. Sorry."""
msc_020120_0070#0,"""Listen, I think Manon...<br>has disappeared."""
msc_020120_0080#0,"""She's been acting really<br>weird lately, right?"""
msc_020120_0090#0,"""Like something's really<br>been bothering her."""
msc_020120_0100#0,"""Every time I'd ask her, she'd always just be like<br>\""I'm fine\"", and stuff like that."""
msc_020120_0110#0,"""I thought maybe she always just felt bad<br>about what happened in Aelio Town..."""
msc_020120_0120#0,"""So I thought that she'd get better<br>once we defeated Dark Falz, right?"""
msc_020120_0130#0,"""...But, when we actually did defeat Dark Falz,<br>she still had that same troubled expression..."""
msc_020120_0140#0,"""So I decided to really sit down and<br>talk with her today, so I went to Manon's room."""
msc_020120_0150#0,"""When I got there, her door was unlocked<br>and she was nowhere to be found..."""
msc_020120_0160#0,"""Her bed was made, and her desk was all<br>tidy and organized, like nobody had been there..."""
msc_020120_0170#0,"""...Save for this single<br>note she left behind..."""
msc_020120_0180#0,"""\""I'm sorry. Thanks for everything.\"""""
msc_020120_0190#0,"""Like, what's that supposed to mean?"""
msc_020120_0200#0,"""I've called her a bunch of times<br>and she won't pick up."""
msc_020120_0210#0,"""What if this is the last time<br>we'll ever see her again?"""
msc_020120_0220#0,"""I've got a really<br>bad feeling about this..."""
msc_020120_0230#0,"""We will definitely see her again."""
msc_020120_0240#0,"""Aina..."""
msc_020120_0250#0,"""...Y-Yeah...<br>You're... right."""
msc_020120_0260#0,"""Yeah..."""
msc_020120_0270#0,"""I'm going to go look for her."""
msc_020120_0280#0,"""First, I'll check in Aelio."""
msc_020120_0290#0,"""If I can't find her, then Retem.<br>Then Kvaris..."""
msc_020120_0300#0,"""First, let's look for eyewitnesses."""
msc_020120_0310#0,"""We should ask someone for advice."""
msc_020120_0320#0,"""Eyewitnesses? Like, ask<br>people if they've seen her?"""
msc_020120_0330#0,"""Someone... but who?"""
msc_020120_0340#0,"""Oh, right. Crawford!"""
msc_020120_0350#0,"""If we go to the Command Room,<br>he should know what to do!"""
