ssc_501060_0010#0,"""Oh, <%me>."""
ssc_501060_0020#0,"""I was just thinking about you.<br>Have some time to talk?"""
ssc_501060_0030#0,"""I was wondering, <%me>, what do you<br>think of the people of Retem?"""
ssc_501060_0040#0,"""They're good people."""
ssc_501060_0050#0,"""What do you mean?"""
ssc_501060_0060#0,"""Yeah, I think so too."""
ssc_501060_0070#0,"""Well... like how you can just talk to them<br>and it's like \""Yeah, these are good people\""."""
ssc_501060_0080#0,"""You know, I used to think the people of Retem<br>were all gonna be scary or something."""
ssc_501060_0090#0,"""Unlike Aelio, there's nothing protecting the people in Retem<br>from all the fighting outside. Everyone's gotta be able to fight here."""
ssc_501060_0100#0,"""I figured Retem was just full of all these<br>battle-hardened tough guys and gals."""
ssc_501060_0110#0,"""You remember how tense everyone was when<br>Lenus Retem could've attacked the town at any moment?"""
ssc_501060_0120#0,"""It felt like they didn't have time<br>to deal with some rookie outsiders like us."""
ssc_501060_0130#0,"""But, after getting a chance to talk to them,<br>I could tell it wasn't like that at all."""
ssc_501060_0140#0,"""When I finally got the courage to<br>talk to them, they were all really friendly."""
ssc_501060_0150#0,"""Whether it was how to walk through the desert,<br>where to find fruits and vegetables..."""
ssc_501060_0160#0,"""Or even which enemies to look out for; they really<br>taught us a lot about daily survival in Retem."""
ssc_501060_0170#0,"""A bunch of people also<br>asked about what Aelio was like."""
ssc_501060_0180#0,"""Aelio and Retem hadn't really interacted that much,<br>so I was surprised to see how interested they were."""
ssc_501060_0190#0,"""I guess they've just been so busy fighting out here,<br>they've never really been able to take it that easy."""
ssc_501060_0200#0,"""The strongest people in Retem don't even brag about it or anything."""
ssc_501060_0210#0,"""They always just thought of their friends,<br>protected the weak, and helped those in need."""
ssc_501060_0220#0,"""Also, everyone would always be talking about Nadereh."""
ssc_501060_0230#0,"""You can really tell how much they all care about her.<br>Everyone's trying to support her in one way or another."""
ssc_501060_0240#0,"""She's a really trustworthy<br>and reliable leader."""
ssc_501060_0250#0,"""There's a really strong sense of unity<br>all throughout Retem City."""
ssc_501060_0260#0,"""...When I really think about it, it kinda resembles<br>how we all were back in Aelio Town, you know?"""
ssc_501060_0270#0,"""Hehe, I guess this place is kind of like<br>my home away from home or something."""
ssc_501060_0280#0,"""I guess that means I'm gonna have to work hard<br>to be recognized as a member of Retem ARKS."""
ssc_501060_0290#0,"""Alright! I'll give it my best!"""
