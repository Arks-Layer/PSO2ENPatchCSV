ssc_508050_0010#0,"""Yeah, that's what I heard from the Lecielans. There's little doubt about it."""
ssc_508050_0020#0,"""Is that so..."""
ssc_508050_0030#0,"""Hey there."""
ssc_508050_0040#0,"""Oh, yeah! We should probably get your opinion as well."""
ssc_508050_0050#0,"""You got a moment?"""
ssc_508050_0060#0,"""Sure."""
ssc_508050_0070#0,"""I'm kinda busy."""
ssc_508050_0080#0,"""Right, thanks."""
ssc_508050_0090#0,"""Oh, don't be like that."""
ssc_508050_0100#0,"""It won't take that long anyways."""
ssc_508050_0110#0,"""I hope Bruder doesn't mind me repeating myself."""
ssc_508050_0120#0,"""Not at all."""
ssc_508050_0130#0,"""...So, we were talking about the DOLLS."""
ssc_508050_0140#0,"""I'm sure you noticed it as well--<br>The many similarities between DOLLS and the Starless."""
ssc_508050_0150#0,"""From the way they move, to the way they look, and more."""
ssc_508050_0160#0,"""For example, when you were fighting in Resol Forest,<br>those were kind of like a Nagrus and Pedas, right?"""
ssc_508050_0170#0,"""Well, their similarity actually makes sense."""
ssc_508050_0180#0,"""Apparently the DOLLS were created to imitate the Starless."""
ssc_508050_0190#0,"""...In other words, they were stand-in enemies.<br>To teach us how to fight the Starless."""
ssc_508050_0200#0,"""...To think that that was all accounted for."""
ssc_508050_0210#0,"""Well, you say that, but the same could be<br>said for Halpha in its entirety..."""
ssc_508050_0220#0,"""The grasslands, the wetlands, the forests and mountains..."""
ssc_508050_0230#0,"""All of it's artificial."""
ssc_508050_0240#0,"""Apparently modeled after various different<br>planets."""
ssc_508050_0250#0,"""That's why each region has such wildly varying<br>ecosystems."""
ssc_508050_0260#0,"""It was with the assumption that we might have to<br>fight the Starless in differing environments."""
ssc_508050_0270#0,"""Same with the buildings and stuff, of course."""
ssc_508050_0280#0,"""The Trainia for example."""
ssc_508050_0290#0,"""They really are training facilities."""
ssc_508050_0300#0,"""Though we've been using them to learn how to<br>fight the DOLLS..."""
ssc_508050_0310#0,"""When in reality they were strengthening us to<br>fight the Starless."""
ssc_508050_0320#0,"""...Mm."""
ssc_508050_0330#0,"""We've always been right in the palm of Zephetto's hand..."""
ssc_508050_0340#0,"""Well, that's exactly why we now need to re-examine<br>everything we know about Halpha."""
ssc_508050_0350#0,"""...Aye, you're right."""
ssc_508050_0360#0,"""If he really planned this far ahead..."""
ssc_508050_0370#0,"""Then perhaps a clue to defeating the Starless is<br>lying hidden somewhere."""
