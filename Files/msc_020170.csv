msc_020170_0040#0,"""Ahhh... How do you open these things again?"""
msc_020170_0050#0,"""Whoever's in there, are you okay?"""
msc_020170_0060#0,"""Oh, right. This thing...<br>Hn... Hngh!!"""
msc_020170_0070#0,"""It opened!<br>Hey, are you okay? Can you move?"""

msc_020170_0150#0,"""...Manon has disappeared."""
msc_020170_0160#0,"""She has? What happened?"""
msc_020170_0170#0,"""Crawford says she probably went... there."""
msc_020170_0180#0,"""To the Floating Island... To Leciel."""
msc_020170_0190#0,"""Wha...?"""
msc_020170_0200#0,"""So that's why we have to find out a way to go there ourselves..."""
msc_020170_0210#0,"""...Sorry, you've lost me."""
msc_020170_0220#0,"""I'll get the details from Crawford when I can."""
msc_020170_0230#0,"""First, though, we have to see that girl to safety."""
msc_020170_0240#0,"""Central City's Medical Center is far more robust than ours..."""
msc_020170_0250#0,"""Bruder, could you transport her there?"""
msc_020170_0260#0,"""Understood."""
msc_020170_0270#0,"""Listen, I'm not sure what's going on with Manon, but..."""
msc_020170_0280#0,"""...For the longest time, I was at a standstill.<br>You three were the ones who got me to start moving again."""
msc_020170_0290#0,"""And the person who put all of it into motion was none other than Manon."""
msc_020170_0300#0,"""I owe a great deal to her."""
msc_020170_0310#0,"""You three are always on my mind."""

msc_020170_0340#0,"""We've finished preparations for transport. We're heading back to Central."""
msc_020170_0350#0,"""Understood."""
msc_020170_0360#0,"""After such a sudden attack, things'll be busy here for a moment, but..."""
msc_020170_0370#0,"""As soon as we get back on our feet, I'll be checking in on you all."""
msc_020170_0380#0,"""If there's a fight, I'll send my troops."""
