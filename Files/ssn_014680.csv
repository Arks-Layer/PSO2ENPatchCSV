ssn_014680_0002#0,"""The Rest Corner is a great place to chat and exchange information with ARKS."""
ssn_014680_0003#0,"""Why not talk with some of the others around here? You might be able to pick up some good info."""
ssn_014680_0101#0,"""Yo! Doing well, I hope?"""
ssn_014680_0102#0,"""Kinda sudden, but don't you think more allies would make it easier to take down tough enemies?"""
ssn_014680_0103#0,"""If you ever want to look for some extra muscle, I could teach you a thing or two."""
ssn_014680_0201#0,"""Basically, just try to form a party. Be like \""Looking for some folks to fight together!\"" or whatever."""
ssn_014680_0202#0,"""If there's anyone in the mood, no doubt they'll join up with you."""

ssn_014680_0403#0,"""Oh, right. I should tell you, another way to get allies would be to join a Team."""
ssn_014680_0404#0,"""Go pay Tim a visit sometime. He's with the Team Support Staff."""
ssn_014680_0405#0,"""Tim's a great guy; he'd be more than happy to teach you all about that stuff!"""
