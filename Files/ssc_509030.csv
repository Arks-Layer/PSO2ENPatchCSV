ssc_509030_0020#0,"""...Oh? Paying a visit?"""
ssc_509030_0030#0,"""Grave tending?"""
ssc_509030_0040#0,"""Visiting family?"""
ssc_509030_0050#0,"""Yeah. It'll get buried in snow<br>if it's not taken care of."""
ssc_509030_0060#0,"""Yeah...<br>My parents, Grandpa..."""
ssc_509030_0070#0,"""Well, actually..."""
ssc_509030_0080#0,"""Nobody has really been buried here."""
ssc_509030_0090#0,"""Not my Dad, my Mom, or Grandpa..."""
ssc_509030_0100#0,"""I don't really remember much<br>about my Mom and Dad."""
ssc_509030_0110#0,"""When we were all still really young, the disaster<br>over by Mt. Latva happened, and that was it."""
ssc_509030_0120#0,"""So we were all pretty much<br>raised by Grandpa."""
ssc_509030_0130#0,"""Grandpa taught us everything about<br>how to live in this world of snow."""
ssc_509030_0140#0,"""And then, not too long ago,<br>during a blizzard one night, Grandpa also..."""
ssc_509030_0150#0,"""People from Aelio helped with the search, but..."""
ssc_509030_0160#0,"""We couldn't even find any clues<br>as to where it happened."""
ssc_509030_0170#0,"""Ever since then, we've pretty much had to<br>provide our own means of living."""
ssc_509030_0180#0,"""The folks from Aelio suggested that<br>we should move to Central City."""
ssc_509030_0190#0,"""But we decided to carry on Grandpa's wishes."""
ssc_509030_0200#0,"""So we stayed here, and<br>that's what we've done."""
ssc_509030_0210#0,"""Although, we've never really been...<br>all that good at it, you know..."""
ssc_509030_0220#0,"""Everyone's been giving it<br>everything they've got, though."""
ssc_509030_0230#0,"""Individually, none of us have ever<br>been on the same page."""
ssc_509030_0240#0,"""We used to fight a lot about<br>what our course of action should be."""
ssc_509030_0250#0,"""Like, \""No, that won't work\"",<br>and \""Here's why you're wrong\""."""
ssc_509030_0260#0,"""Without knowing what to do,<br>the only thing that progressed was time."""
ssc_509030_0270#0,"""Realizing that this wasn't working,<br>Ilma went off on his own."""
ssc_509030_0280#0,"""And then you three came along."""
ssc_509030_0290#0,"""I'm so glad we didn't just<br>keep on making mistakes like that."""
ssc_509030_0300#0,"""Thanks to you all, I think<br>we can proceed without any issues."""
ssc_509030_0310#0,"""That includes \""Lost Central\""..."""
ssc_509030_0320#0,"""As well as the powerful enemies<br>that we'll surely have to fight."""
ssc_509030_0330#0,"""If anything happens,<br>let us know right away."""
ssc_509030_0340#0,"""It's our turn to help you now."""
ssc_509030_0350#0,"""I mean... I'm not that strong by myself, but..."""
ssc_509030_0360#0,"""With all five of us,<br>we won't be losing to anyone."""
ssc_509030_0370#0,"""Let me promise you once more."""
ssc_509030_0380#0,"""In front of both Grandpa,<br>and my Mom and Dad."""
ssc_509030_0390#0,"""We'll support your battle<br>with all our strength."""
ssc_509030_0400#0,"""You can count on us."""
