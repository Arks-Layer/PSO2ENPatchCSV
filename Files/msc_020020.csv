msc_020020_0020#0,"""This is the day we've<br>all been preparing for."""
msc_020020_0030#0,"""To defeat the one that massacred Aelio Town<br>with merciless blades of light."""
msc_020020_0040#0,"""Today, we defeat Dark Falz."""
msc_020020_0050#0,"""Right now, he is likely hiding in another dimension,<br>mending the wounds he received from the Central Cannon."""
msc_020020_0060#0,"""However, he cannot fully heal without<br>using that docking station in Stia."""
msc_020020_0070#0,"""Sooner or later, he will have to<br>reappear in this world."""
msc_020020_0080#0,"""...That's when we'll attack."""
msc_020020_0090#0,"""The completed Central Cannon can be<br>used for long periods of time."""
msc_020020_0100#0,"""The barrel can now withstand<br>multiple shots in a row."""
msc_020020_0110#0,"""However, it still takes considerable time<br>until it's actually ready to fire."""
msc_020020_0120#0,"""Try as we might, we haven't been<br>able to shorten its boot sequence."""
msc_020020_0130#0,"""When Dark Falz appears, I'm going to need you to<br>stall him until the Cannon's ready."""
msc_020020_0140#0,"""You all stand here today<br>having overcome many hardships."""
msc_020020_0150#0,"""Dark Falz is a being that goes<br>far beyond anything we can imagine."""
msc_020020_0160#0,"""Even if we're perfectly prepared for this,<br>there's no telling what could happen."""
msc_020020_0170#0,"""However, even if things don't<br>go according to plan..."""
msc_020020_0180#0,"""I believe we'll be able to<br>deal with it, come what may."""

msc_020020_0210#0,"""Kvaris..."""
msc_020020_0220#0,"""And now ARKS from Stia, all<br>working together, hand-in-hand."""
msc_020020_0230#0,"""As far as I know, this has never happened<br>before in the history of Halpha."""
msc_020020_0240#0,"""Halpha has finally<br>united together as one."""
msc_020020_0250#0,"""So, if we want to continue<br>fostering these good relations..."""
msc_020020_0260#0,"""Then this battle is one we<br>absolutely cannot afford to lose."""
msc_020020_0270#0,"""This is something that will<br>require everyone's strength."""
