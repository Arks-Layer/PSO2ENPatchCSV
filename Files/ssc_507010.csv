ssc_507010_0010#0,"""Ah, <%me>."""
ssc_507010_0020#0,"""Say... have a moment to<br>listen to an old story?"""
ssc_507010_0030#0,"""I'm interested."""
ssc_507010_0040#0,"""If it's short."""
ssc_507010_0050#0,"""Mm."""
ssc_507010_0060#0,"""Come now, don't be like that."""
ssc_507010_0070#0,"""For a while now, I've had no love<br>for this place... This El-Nossa."""
ssc_507010_0080#0,"""It reminds me of that<br>fateful day, you see."""
ssc_507010_0090#0,"""One day when Nadereh performed<br>her song in front of everyone."""
ssc_507010_0100#0,"""The crowd went deathly silent.<br>She went pale and froze up."""
ssc_507010_0110#0,"""In a panic, I dispersed the crowd, but she stayed there.<br>Quietly sobbing; trembling in silence."""
ssc_507010_0120#0,"""Never before and never since have I<br>seen her wear such an expression."""
ssc_507010_0130#0,"""Until that day, everyone just<br>assumed she had the Power of Song."""
ssc_507010_0140#0,"""The Power of Song, you see, had always<br>been passed down from parent to child."""
ssc_507010_0150#0,"""Her power isn't something that's<br>meant to be shown off to people."""
ssc_507010_0160#0,"""Especially not at such a young age, before<br>the power has had a chance to stabilize."""
ssc_507010_0170#0,"""She was forbidden to show her song<br>to anyone but her mother, Alderea."""
ssc_507010_0180#0,"""At that time, Alderea told me<br>of Nadereh's Power of Song."""
ssc_507010_0190#0,"""She said that one day, Nadereh's power<br>would surpass even her own."""
ssc_507010_0200#0,"""After Alderea had passed, I still didn't<br>know what she really meant by that."""
ssc_507010_0210#0,"""I thought that what Alderea felt<br>was not Nadereh's Power of Song..."""
ssc_507010_0220#0,"""But perhaps that it was her own power,<br>merely being influenced by Nadereh's singing."""
ssc_507010_0230#0,"""...In any case, nobody would realize what<br>Nadereh's true power was until you kids came along."""
ssc_507010_0240#0,"""You can imagine how she must've<br>been after such an event as that."""
ssc_507010_0250#0,"""She focused single-mindedly on her martial arts, as if she was<br>trying to make up for the apparent loss of her Power of Song."""
ssc_507010_0260#0,"""We, as her loyal retainers, pursued<br>strength with equal fervor to support her."""
ssc_507010_0270#0,"""Due to Nadereh's sudden lack of singing, Retem's<br>entire musical culture also fell into decline."""
ssc_507010_0280#0,"""Day after day, we would wake up, fight<br>enemies until exhaustion, and then sleep."""
ssc_507010_0290#0,"""By the time we realized it, this<br>had already become our routine."""
ssc_507010_0300#0,"""If we kept it up, then the ARKS<br>of Retem would have collapsed one day."""
ssc_507010_0310#0,"""When I started earnestly holding those worries,<br>you and those girls appeared, and quite dashingly so."""
ssc_507010_0320#0,"""These three youngsters would<br>change something in us all."""
ssc_507010_0330#0,"""Thinking on it now--though I have no evidence to support it--<br>I would say it was watching you three fight."""
ssc_507010_0340#0,"""And, as for the rest, well...<br>You kids would know more than I."""
ssc_507010_0350#0,"""Nadereh's true power manifested,<br>and Lenus Retem was defeated."""
ssc_507010_0360#0,"""And so, music returned to Retem."""
ssc_507010_0370#0,"""Allow me to say this again:<br>Thank you."""
ssc_507010_0380#0,"""I also really like the music of Retem."""
ssc_507010_0390#0,"""They say song and battle are two sides of the same coin."""
ssc_507010_0400#0,"""Thank you."""
ssc_507010_0410#0,"""Tell the others as well.<br>It would make their day to hear that."""
ssc_507010_0420#0,"""Aye. It's something that cannot be<br>separated from the ARKS of Retem."""
ssc_507010_0430#0,"""Though it took me many years to realize that."""
ssc_507010_0440#0,"""Thanks to you and yours, it no longer stings this<br>old heart of mine to stand before El-Nossa."""
ssc_507010_0450#0,"""We are truly indebted to you."""
ssc_507010_0460#0,"""From now on, it will be our<br>turn to pay back this debt."""
ssc_507010_0470#0,"""If you're ever in a spot of<br>trouble, just say the word."""
