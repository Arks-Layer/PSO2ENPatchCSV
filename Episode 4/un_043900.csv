un_043900_0010#0,"""<%me>, is something wrong? Is there something strange with how I look?"""
un_043900_0020#0,"""1. Your hair color, is that...?"""
un_043900_0030#0,"""2. The atmosphere around you seems a bit strange."""
un_043900_0040#0,"""My hair color? I guess you could say it's... a feature."""
un_043900_0050#0,"""Oh... I see. But I'm just an ordinary ARKS operative."""
un_043900_0060#0,"""There's not really a point in lying about that, Aika."""
un_043900_0070#0,"""Commander."""
un_043900_0080#0,"""Like you, Aika bears the burden of having temporarily held Dark Falz's power. At this point though, it's more akin to a scar."""
un_043900_0090#0,"""Half a year ago, there was an incident where Dark Falz [Apprentice] had tried to resurrect itself."""
un_043900_0100#0,"""With Matoi's help, we were able to seal Dark Falz [Apprentice] away again, but..."""
un_043900_0110#0,"""I was a bit reckless. ...This coloring was a result."""
un_043900_0120#0,"""\""A bit reckless\"" is an irresponsible explanation. Not only did you cause Matoi --who had just awoken-- to become involved, but things almost got out of hand."""
un_043900_0130#0,"""That's true... But..."""
un_043900_0140#0,"""1. ...Matoi was involved as well?"""
un_043900_0150#0,"""2. I want to know the full story."""
un_043900_0160#0,"""Alright. Perhaps this would be a good time to explain, don't you think, Aika?"""
un_043900_0170#0,"""I'd taken all of Dark Falz's energy from Itsuki and Rina --I mean, our allies-- and was prepared to be sealed as a consequence."""
un_043900_0180#0,"""But Matoi, intent on saving me, took it unto herself, with the intent on redirecting it back into Lilipa to seal it there again."""
un_043900_0190#0,"""However, Matoi was recently reawakened, and was subsequently in a weakened state, and was unable to control it."""
un_043900_0200#0,"""She'd begun to absorb the energy gathered within Aika's body into her own."""
un_043900_0210#0,"""I'm certain that Matoi knew what would happen."""
un_043900_0220#0,"""As a vessel for such energies, Matoi is on a whole different level than I. She knew the consequences of saving me."""
un_043900_0230#0,"""Even if she would become the [Profound Darkness] once again, she was prepared to sacrifice herself without looking back."""
un_043900_0240#0,"""But then something happened out of nowhere."""
un_043900_0250#0,"""\""Dio Hunar\"". It's referred to by ARKS as the incarnation of the [Profound Darkness]. According to our records, it was present for less than a minute."""
un_043900_0260#0,"""Without intentions of restoring, nor awakening Dark Falz [Apprentice], it absorbed the darkness from us both... and left."""
un_043900_0270#0,"""It had simply looked at Matoi... then left."""
un_043900_0280#0,"""And that's what happened. The rest was mostly cleanup, but that proved to be the hardest part."""
un_043900_0290#0,"""While Aika had miraculously managed to avoid becoming a vessel for Dark Falz, her body was corrupted to a noticable extent. I'm honestly amazed she's survived this ordeal."""
un_043900_0300#0,"""I have Matoi to thank for that. It took me half a year to recover, but I am walking well with minimal damage."""
un_043900_0310#0,"""Matoi, unfortunately, had to return to a temporary cold sleep afterwards to purify the corruption."""
un_043900_0320#0,"""Because of her previous records, I'm sure you understand the medical team's full alert regarding her status."""
un_043900_0330#0,"""That said, you shouldn't have to wait much longer."""
un_043900_0340#0,"""I received a message from the medical team a few days ago. You should be able to see her soon."""
un_043900_0350#0,"""I'm still confused by Dio Hunar's actions."""
un_043900_0360#0,"""Why did it leave without doing anything to us? I still don't understand why."""
un_043900_0370#0,"""A good question... but I don't think you or I will ever know. We are not it, after all."""
un_043900_0380#0,"""Though, you might have an idea yourself. Am I correct?"""
