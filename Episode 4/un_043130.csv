un_043130_0020#0,"""<%me>. This is the second time we've met like this. Again, I'm Aika, from the Intelligence Unit."""
un_043130_0030#0,"""Under orders from my Commander, Casra, I'll be stationed here for a while."""
un_043130_0040#0,"""Apparently it's to make sure intel is kept from the Chief Commander, but..."""
un_043130_0050#0,"""...The real reason is for surveillance."""
un_043130_0060#0,"""You WERE actually going to say it!"""
