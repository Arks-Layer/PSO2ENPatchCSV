st_042015_0010#0,"""Hey, <%me>, apart from collecting information from Hitsugi, would it be okay if you gather information about Earth?"""
st_042015_0020#0,"""Remember those monsters you fought when you saved Hitsugi? I would like you to gather more information on them."""
st_042015_0030#0,"""ARKS has categorized those new monsters under the \""Phantom\"" class. Our databases have no information of encounters prior to Earth."""
st_042015_0040#0,"""However, ever since we first discovered Earth, we've been detecting large quantities of Phantoms."""
st_042015_0050#0,"""They could easily have begun lumbering about some time ago."""
st_042015_0060#0,"""Despite that, we know for a fact that they are not native. Although their origins are unknown, we shouldn't leave such a harmful species alone."""
st_042015_0070#0,"""All that's certain for now is that they materialized through some unknown method."""
st_042015_0080#0,"""Materialized... similarly to how we manipulate and materialize photons."""
st_042015_0090#0,"""With that said, all we have to do is to give them baddies a good ol' one-two. If it's our trusty <%me>, it should be a breeze!"""
st_042015_0100#0,"""By the way, you should be free to operate on Earth! The Optic Camo and Spatial Quarantine seem in order. Man, ARKS' technology surprises even me sometimes!"""
st_042015_0110#0,"""And with THAT said, I'd like to ask you a favor:"""
st_042015_0120#0,"""Head on over to Earth and give the Phantoms a good taste of what you're made of!"""
