st_047030_0010#0,"""Say, Hitsugi. Are you really going to fight Mother?"""
st_047030_0020#0,"""What? You're scared about it now?"""
st_047030_0030#0,"""Oh, no, that's not what I meant... I was just thinking, maybe this entire situation has gotten too big for us to handle."""
st_047030_0040#0,"""Yeah... This situation is definitely more than I expected."""
st_047030_0050#0,"""Mother cluster apostles... embodied weapons, ESCA darkers... They would've been unthinkable before."""
st_047030_0060#0,"""But, no matter how out of control things seem, my goal will not change."""
st_047030_0070#0,"""I am going to rescue Aru from Mother. That's my only goal."""
st_047030_0080#0,"""I see."""
st_047030_0090#0,"""Kohri, you're still hesitant, right? Whether or not you should fight against Mother."""
st_047030_0100#0,"""Wha?! N-No, that's not..."""
st_047030_0110#0,"""Is Mother right, or is she wrong? Are we right, or are we wrong? That's something we won't know as we're involved."""
st_047030_0120#0,"""That's why it's not important. What's important is what you want to do."""
st_047030_0130#0,"""Think for yourself, and decide for yourself... That's all."""
st_047030_0140#0,"""Kohri, if you're still lost, you don't have to come with me. Being lost can lead to painful experiences."""
st_047030_0150#0,"""Hitsugi wants to save Aru. Then I want to support Hitsugi. That's my only goal."""
st_047030_0160#0,"""That's why I'm not hesitating or lost. I'm going to go with Hitsugi."""
st_047030_0170#0,"""Kohri..."""
st_047030_0180#0,"""Besides, if Mother is wrong, then we have to help her stop... As members of Mother Cluster."""
st_047030_0190#0,"""Then, as usual, I'll be moving fast and without mercy. Best be prepared, Kohri."""
st_047030_0200#0,"""Yes."""
st_047030_0210#0,"""...Hitsugi, you've changed."""
st_047030_0220#0,"""Really? Maybe it's just my tough act?"""
st_047030_0230#0,"""Nope, that's not true. Before, your answers were based on logic, and you pushed on because of that, but now you're different."""
st_047030_0240#0,"""Saying what you want, doing as you feel, gathering momentum every step."""
st_047030_0250#0,"""I'm hearing that as \""acting without thinking\""... but I guess you're right."""
st_047030_0260#0,"""But you know... I like this Hitsugi more."""
st_047030_0270#0,"""...Oh, is this where you get mad and go \""Stop pretending to be Hitsugi!\""? or say \""You're a fake!\"" and cut me down?"""
st_047030_0280#0,"""D-Don't bring that stuff up!"""
st_047030_0290#0,"""Besides, you were really ambiguous at the time, you know! You really did seem like a fake, you know!"""
st_047030_0300#0,"""You're quick to spit poison. I mean, I was pretty unsure at the time, but..."""
st_047030_0310#0,"""But then, at that time, Kohri cut me down good, so I was able to come to my senses."""
st_047030_0320#0,"""Uuuuuu... cut me! Cut me down too! And then... stab me! Hitsugi, kill me with your own two hands!"""
st_047030_0330#0,"""And I'll live on forever in Hitsugi's heart, for all eternity..."""
st_047030_0340#0,"""Oh, that might be really romantic! To keep existing forever in your heart... very poetic!"""
st_047030_0350#0,"""...I want to learn how you are never shaken, no matter the circumstances."""
