un_044060_0020#0,"""Wha- what's this all of the sudden, Aru?"""
un_044060_0030#0,"""<%me> and big sis's job is to go down to Earth and fight and stuff, right?"""
un_044060_0040#0,"""Well, not for me, but that's correct for <%me>."""
un_044060_0050#0,"""Shouldn't you go too, Sierra? Or is sitting and talking her job?"""
un_044060_0060#0,"""Ooooh! The way Aru said that makes it sound like I'm just chattering around and skipping work!"""
un_044060_0070#0,"""1. You're wrong."""
un_044060_0080#0,"""2. Isn't that right?"""
un_044060_0090#0,"""Thanks, <%me>. Listen Aru, I have my own job as well."""
un_044060_0100#0,"""Wait, <%me>! Aru might believe that, just let me explain it to them."""
un_044060_0110#0,"""You see, Aru, it's a job that only I can do."""
un_044060_0120#0,"""Sierra's job?"""
un_044060_0130#0,"""My official title is Special Calculative Management Administrator High Cast. Calculating and managing the ARKS Ship is my main job."""
un_044060_0140#0,"""I make adjustments in order for the residents in the ship to live comfortably, as well as sending intelligence to all ARKS."""
un_044060_0150#0,"""So you were doing all of that...I don't see any of that, though."""
un_044060_0160#0,"""I can feel the thorns of every word you speak... Although, despite appearances, I'm basically a dilligent worker. Ahem!"""
un_044060_0170#0,"""I think there are ARKS who are still going on sorties as we speak... Shouldn't you go and support them as well?"""
un_044060_0180#0,"""Fufu, don't underestimate me too much! While we're chatting, that level of parallel processing is a piece of cake! It's my specialty."""
un_044060_0190#0,"""I won't lose to Xiao, even if it's just calculations for management. However, I do lose elsewhere though..."""
un_044060_0200#0,"""Furthermore, talking with all of you is also part of my job."""
un_044060_0210#0,"""The previous managers, the Photoners, gave no effort in trying to understand the hearts of people. Thus, they used them as pawns. The result of that was the collapse of order."""
un_044060_0220#0,"""The hearts of people are frail, and easily broken. However, at times, it becomes a vivid and powerful weapon."""
un_044060_0230#0,"""While I'm an administrator, I'm also a person with a heart. Not only providing intelligence, I also want to provide strength by interacting and connecting with everyone."""
un_044060_0240#0,"""Therefore, I chatter! Now everyone, let's continue to have pointless conversations together!"""
un_044060_0250#0,"""It would have been a much better speech without adding that last line..."""
