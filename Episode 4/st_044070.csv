st_044070_0010#0,"""Alright, we're here."""
st_044070_0020#0,"""Wow! So pretty! This place is huge!<br>To build something like this under Las Vegas...<br>What kind of organizational capacity does Earth Guide even have...?"""
st_044070_0030#0,"""After entering a casino in Las Vegas,<br>we went further underground via elevator and<br>changed elevators twice again before reaching our destination..."""
st_044070_0040#0,"""It seems like they've taken extreme caution to<br>prevent any specific pin-points from being made."""
st_044070_0050#0,"""Well, it's just in case. Although, I'm not sure how much it'd even help in this world, with the widespread Ether infrastructure."""
st_044070_0060#0,"""Haha, things are getting quite lively around here, aren't they?"""
st_044070_0070#0,"""That's what I told you before. And even so, you still insisted I bring them here. Isn't that right, prince?"""
st_044070_0080#0,"""I don't mind, I prefer things to be lively."""
st_044070_0090#0,"""<%me>, Hitsugi. It's an honor to meet you both."""
st_044070_0100#0,"""My name is Ardem Sacred. Although, there are those who tease me and call me 'Prince'. But please, call me by my name."""
st_044070_0110#0,"""Prince...? Then, wait, you're...!"""
st_044070_0120#0,"""Correct. To put it plainly, I am currently the leader of Earth Guide. I'm looking forward to working with you."""
st_044070_0130#0,"""Ah, uhm, same here. Thank you."""
st_044070_0140#0,"""<%me>. I've heard many rumors about you. I'm honored to finally meet you in person."""
st_044070_0150#0,"""I'm sorry for having to invite you to a place like this."""
st_044070_0160#0,"""1. Many rumors?"""
st_044070_0170#0,"""2. Don't worry about it."""
st_044070_0180#0,"""You didn't hear about it from Enga? For some time now, Earth Guide and ARKS have been communicating in secret."""
st_044070_0190#0,"""I've been told many things about you, <%me>. Powerful, righteous... and with a kind heart."""
st_044070_0200#0,"""Haha, I see. The rumors of you being kind are true."""
st_044070_0210#0,"""All the stories I've heard about you were full of compliments and praise. It seems you mostly just nod and smile, dealing with whatever comes your way."""
st_044070_0220#0,"""And when I think to myself that you all came from an alternate dimension... As an Earthling, this meeting has me deep in thought."""
st_044070_0230#0,"""Oh, right... PSO2 isn't a game, but a window to an alternate dimension... So, <%me> is technically a space alien."""
st_044070_0240#0,"""Or rather, someone from another world? A person from an alternate dimension? What am I supposed to label them? Ugh, I guess it's not important..."""
st_044070_0250#0,"""I guess because of all the commotion and talking we did, I never really gave it much thought, but... This is actually a pretty big deal, huh?"""
st_044070_0260#0,"""It's probably enough to spin the heads of scientists studying the Earth and it's life."""
st_044070_0270#0,"""Now, I have gathered you all here for a reason. Please let me explain the current situation on Earth."""
st_044070_0280#0,"""The increase of Mother Cluster actively has been noticed by ARKS as well."""
st_044070_0290#0,"""On Earth's side, the attacks on Earth Guide has increased. Most branches and members have suffered losses... To be honest, our situation is kind of grim."""
st_044070_0300#0,"""Previously, we had a lot of situations where we would just have a staredown, but now it seems they've stopped caring. They're agressively trying to destroy us."""
st_044070_0310#0,"""Maybe they were waiting until they were ready, or they needed to rush into it all of the sudden... There's no way of knowing, but it's a pretty bad situation either way."""
st_044070_0320#0,"""Tell me, please, what is Mother Cluster's motive? What do they plan to do after they destroy Earth Guide?"""
st_044070_0330#0,"""After the destruction of Earth Guide, they'd be able to completely conquer the Earth. We're the last bastion of hope."""
st_044070_0340#0,"""In some ways, their control of the Ether infrastructure has really helped them with that goal."""
st_044070_0345#0,"""Although, it doesn't explain why they're using PSO2 to try and infiltrate the Oracle fleet."""
st_044070_0350#0,"""1. Are they planning to take over our world too?"""
st_044070_0360#0,"""2. Is there something in our world they need?"""
st_044070_0370#0,"""Perhaps... Clearly, there must be something in the ARKS universe that they need."""
st_044070_0380#0,"""So, Ms. stupid younger sister, former member of Mother Cluster, what do you think?"""
st_044070_0390#0,"""Stop talking to me like that! But, hm... what are mother's intentions...?"""
st_044070_0400#0,"""It's been quite a while since I joined Mother Cluster... I was told I was invited because 'I had experience'."""
st_044070_0410#0,"""'Experience' like refers to your ability to enter PSO2. That's an Ether ability, so it seems like they're gathering those with an aptitude for it."""
st_044070_0420#0,"""They're likely trying to find people with high potential. Learning the different abilites of Ether would be like master the technology. If you understand how it works and devote yourself, you should get more powerful."""
st_044070_0430#0,"""Wait, so it's something that can be mastered through hard work and practice? Like making a weapon out of Ether?"""
st_044070_0434#0,"""To put it simply, the more your aptitude with Ether rises, the more you can do with it."""
st_044070_0438#0,"""Furthermore, even regular people without an aptitude for Ether, through PSO2, can remotely control an avatar created in Oracle to enjoy the game."""
st_044070_0440#0,"""However, PSO2 is an application created by Mother to infiltrate Oracle undetected."""
st_044070_0444#0,"""Hence, whenever an ordinary person plays PSO2 as a normal game, Mother is still gaining intelligence on ARKS."""
st_044070_0448#0,"""The other role of the PSO2 application is to scout out people with high Ether aptitude."""
st_044070_0450#0,"""To make it easier to understand... If we use levels to show aptitude, someone who has a level 1 aptitude can dive into PSO2."""
st_044070_0454#0,"""Diving into PSO2 is when you merge with the avatar you created in PSO2 and allows one to move as you would your own body."""
st_044070_0458#0,"""These level 1 aptitude users are discovered by Mother and chosen to be part of Mother Cluster."""
st_044070_0460#0,"""Once their aptitude rises, and becomes level 2, it becomes possible to dive without an avatar. You can cross over with your own body."""
st_044070_0465#0,"""In addition, the embodiment of Ether into a weapon becomes possible."""
st_044070_0470#0,"""So, according to this explanation, both Enga and Ms. Hitsugi have already reached level 2."""
st_044070_0480#0,"""Those who have reached that point become the core of Mother Cluster and strengthen their influence over the world."""
st_044070_0490#0,"""Making use of Mother Cluster, they become successful in this society. For example, Hagito and Bethor."""
st_044070_0500#0,"""Among the core members of Mother Cluster, the seven with exceptional abilities are known as apostles and are treated as Mother's closest aides."""
st_044070_0510#0,"""The benefits in society obtained from becoming an apostle must be something grand."""
st_044070_0520#0,"""I see... So me and Kori were invited to Mother Cluster because of our level 1 aptitude to Ether."""
st_044070_0530#0,"""While bringing in those who have experience, they likely that that if even a fraction of them progressed to level 2, it would be worth it."""
st_044070_0540#0,"""Nonetheless, I'm surprised Earth Guide had figured that out."""
st_044070_0550#0,"""We also have quite an influence within this society, you see."""
st_044070_0560#0,"""That's right. I don't know what this guy did, but he has a court rank. He's Sir Ardem."""
st_044070_0570#0,"""Actually, before the existence of Mother Cluster, we had something close to weapon embodiment."""
st_044070_0580#0,"""Something close to weapon embodiment?"""
st_044070_0590#0,"""To the general public, it's known as 'Magic'. It's the general term for supernatural-esque phenomena that has been kept secret for generations."""
st_044070_0600#0,"""I can show you if you want. It's very tedious though, with magic circles and talismans and much more."""
st_044070_0610#0,"""Earth group wasn't originally formed to fight Mother Cluster."""
st_044070_0620#0,"""In the far past, those with abilities gathered together to form Earth Guide, with the purpose of solving the mysterious incidents and phenomena in the world."""
st_044070_0630#0,"""People like sorcerers and magicians. In Japan, it's the sort of thing we call 'Exorcists', the way of Yin and Yang. A group of people like that."""
st_044070_0640#0,"""Angels and devils, demons and ghosts... Earth Guide was designed to deal with those abnormal entities that are normally unseen."""
st_044070_0650#0,"""That said, these phenomena were not a common occurance. Earth Guide had no problems maintaining and controlling the order."""
st_044070_0660#0,"""However, that changed 12 years ago."""
st_044070_0670#0,"""12 years ago was... the year Ether was discovered. ESCA gained popularity and... Mother Cluster was formed."""
st_044070_0680#0,"""Correct. During that year, all over the world, paranormal phenomena because alarmingly more frequent. The number of people who awakened to their abilites also increased."""
st_044070_0690#0,"""...I'm one of them."""
st_044070_0700#0,"""Those who awakened to their abilities like Enga and Ms. Hitsugi can manipulate Ether at will."""
st_044070_0710#0,"""However, even if they haven't awakened to their abilities, through the fears of people, a general image begins to take shape and form from their minds."""
st_044070_0720#0,"""So... An embodied weapon is the manifestation of an individual's will, and phantoms are compilations of everyone's fears?"""
st_044070_0730#0,"""Yes, that's the general jist of it."""
st_044070_0740#0,"""And now, Mother Cluster is controlling the phantoms, and manipulating them to turn against us."""
st_044070_0750#0,"""...Likely, to ease their conquest of the Earth."""
st_044070_0760#0,"""Since ancient times, we protected people from those which are not human. This is no exception."""
st_044070_0770#0,"""However... Mother Cluster's strength is extraordinary, and with only our power... Well, you know."""
st_044070_0780#0,"""So, <%me>. I beg of you. Please let us borrow your power... the power of ARKS."""
st_044070_0790#0,"""To defeat Mother and return to the Earth to it's proper path..."""
st_044070_0800#0,"""What?! An earthquake?!"""
st_044070_0810#0,"""No... that was an explosion!"""
st_044070_0820#0,"""エーテルの過剰反応を感知。<br>地上に閉鎖領域を展開しました。"""
st_044070_0830#0,"""……ずいぶん早いご到着だな。<br>アーデム、どうする？"""
st_044070_0840#0,"""アースガイドの意志を<br>示す時が来たんだよ。"""
st_044070_0850#0,"""アースガイドは、アークスと共に<br>マザーへと反抗する。<br>ここがその起点となる場所だ。"""
st_044070_0860#0,"""……真っ向迎え撃つ、ってわけだな。<br>まったく、オレたち働き者だぜ、なあ？"""
