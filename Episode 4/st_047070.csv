st_047070_0030#0,"""It looks like some extra people tagged along... I'll tolerate it. I will forgive you for stepping foot into this place."""
st_047070_0040#0,"""Aren't you the arrogant one, Mother? You almost act like we're trespassing into your territory."""
st_047070_0050#0,"""Strangely enough, that phrase works perfectly."""
st_047070_0060#0,"""It's exactly as you said, Enga Yasaka. This place is a part of me."""
st_047070_0070#0,"""<%me>. Don't you remember this place? You should know a place very similar to this."""
st_047070_0080#0,"""1. The center of the mothership"""
st_047070_0090#0,"""2. Inside of Xion"""
st_047070_0100#0,"""Indeed. This is a place that I myself have created. This is my place, fixated to this world."""
st_047070_0110#0,"""I was born through the Photoners, and through their selfishness, abandoned into subspace for such a long time... wandering space, eventually making my way to ancient Earth."""
st_047070_0120#0,"""My, how long ago was that... I collided with the Earth, and that shockwave forever changed Earth, carrying out a new evolution."""
st_047070_0130#0,"""I, who broke into pieces upon impact with the Earth, began to re-assemble in one place and took shape."""
st_047070_0140#0,"""This shape, my body, is what they named \""The Moon\"". This place."""
st_047070_0150#0,"""No way, you were the Giant Impact?!"""
st_047070_0160#0,"""Impressive knowledge, Enga Yasaka. Yes, that's what earthlings named the creation of the moon."""
st_047070_0170#0,"""Though, it wasn't a planet that hit the Earth. It was an abandoned clone of an akashic record, although they obviously couldn't know that."""
st_047070_0180#0,"""ESCA Darkers?! Even in this place?!"""
st_047070_0190#0,"""Don't interfere, lowly Darkers. I'm still here. My goal is still achieveable."""

st_047070_0240#0,"""You... absorbed Aru for that reason? To gain power for your revenge?"""

st_047070_0260#0,"""Aru... The fusion of Dark Falz, Ether, and Photons... A suitable body for my goals."""
st_047070_0270#0,"""However, the connections that remain within him... Hitsugi Yasaka and <%me>... Your connections continue to justify his existence."""

st_047070_0340#0,"""You're right, Mother. My goal is to take back Aru. For that... I will defeat you."""
st_047070_0350#0,"""My goal is revenge on the Photoners. For that, I will kill both Hitsugi Yasaka and <%me>."""
