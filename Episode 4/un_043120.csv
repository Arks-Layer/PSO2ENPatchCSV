un_043120_0040#0,"""Oh, my friend, how rude of me. I haven't introduced you to her yet. She is my beloved Elizabeth. Cute, right?"""
un_043120_0050#0,"""1. You love more than one of them?"""

un_043120_0070#0,"""That's a foolish question, my friend. I love each and every one of them equally. How there are is not an issue."""
