text02#0,"""そりゃおれは見られないわけだよ。<br>基本的に一人で動くし、戦う前に<br>逃げるからな。"""
text03#0,"""ま、これからも縁はなさそうだけど<br>ＰＳＥバースト自体にはちょっと<br>興味があるんだよな。"""
text04#0,"""だから、相棒！<br>今度ＰＳＥバーストを体験することが<br>あったら、データを取っといてくれ！"""
text05#0,"""別に難しいことはなにもなくて<br>現象を体験しただけで、データは<br>勝手に取られてるからさ！"""
text100#0,"""PSE"""
text101#0,"""Defeating enemies stimulates the photons in the atmosphere, which affects the abilities of ARKS operatives. This effect is known as PSE (Photon Sensitive Effect). PSE can cause anything from a simple boost in abilities, to an increase in the amount of meseta dropped, or extra experience from combat."""
text102#0,"""There are eight levels of PSE, and the level rises as you continue to defeat enemies, enhancing the effect produced. When photons are stimulated at PSE level 8, a PSE burst is triggered. When a PSE burst occurs, the photons in the atmosphere become highly charged, dramatically enhancing abilities."""
text103#0,"""This effect only lasts a limited time, but it can be extended by defeating enemies to keep photons in a state of excitation. A sign of some kind is given just before PSE is about to occur, so keep an eye out and utilize PSE to its best effect."""
