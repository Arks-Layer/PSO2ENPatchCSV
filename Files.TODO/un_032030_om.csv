un_032030_0020#0,"""What mystery? It's public knowledge that Luther used them as a research facility."""
un_032030_0030#0,"""But wait!! Our intrepid explorers Patty & Tea are stopped by mysterious new enemies!!"""
un_032030_0040#0,"""Hello? No mystery here. They're all Oceanids that came from inside."""

un_032030_0080#0,"""Gosh, we combed the Coast, and then the Seabed... who'da thunk there's still more here?"""
un_032030_0090#0,"""Even I, the Great Patty, could not predict this turn of events!!"""
un_032030_0100#0,"""The rubble on the beach, the strange buildings undersea, and now these floating ruins. Apparently, all were built by the ancient Photoners."""

un_032030_0150#0,"""Hah ha! The Photoners made their own Water Park!"""
un_032030_0160#0,"""Excuse me?"""
un_032030_0170#0,"""Look! Ocean in all directions along with this amazing weather! You gotta be crazy not to enjoy it!"""
un_032030_0180#0,"""That... is an actual possibility. Past records suggest they were somewhat whimsical..."""
un_032030_0190#0,"""Everyone needs to cut loose now and then! ARKS and Photoners alike!"""
