# PSO2 English Patch 
Welcome to the PSO2 English Patch CSV Repository.

This repository is dedicated to translating PSO2 game texts from Japanese to English. Our goal is to complete the English translations first, so that it can be used to translate the game to other non-English languages.

We hope our disclosing of game texts and opening this repository will pave a quicker way for non-Japanese speaking ARKS to enjoy the game in their native languages in the future.

## Contributions
### To-Do
If you would like to help with the untranslated scenes then please see [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10baB8072UEwQEjdtV-AE_tVUXEDmdENJcfG5Mn8av18/edit#gid=0) for a list of files which need to be translated.

### Don't know Japanese but still want to contribute?
If you don't understand Japanese, but still want to help out, you can look over the translated lines and make sure all grammar and spelling is correct. (US English, please!)

### Notice
* If you want to translate a file that's in the "/Files/" directory then you <b>MUST</b> [move the file into another directory](https://github.com/blog/1436-moving-and-renaming-files-on-github) before you translate it. The /Files/ directory <b>MUST</b> only contain untranslated files.
* Maintain the triple quotes and only edit the text inside the quotes.
* Be sure to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/Arks-Layer/PSO2ENPatchCSV/wiki"><strong>Wiki</strong></a> page for guides and reminders before sending us your translations.
* You may create new issues to discuss the translations with other translators. Please note that issues not related to translation may be deleted without notice.
