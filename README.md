# PSO2 English Patch 
Welcome to the PSO2 English Patch CSV Repository.

This repository is dedicated to translating PSO2 game texts from Japanese to English. Our goal is to complete the English translations first, so that it can be used to translate the game to other non-English languages.

We hope our disclosing of game texts and opening this repository will pave a quicker way for non-Japanese speaking ARKS to enjoy the game in their native languages in the future.
