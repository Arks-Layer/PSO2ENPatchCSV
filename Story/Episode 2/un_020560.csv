un_020560_0010#0,"""Yo sir. We seem to run into each other often. I guess you almost work as hard as me."""
un_020560_0020#0,"""There are plenty of Humans, Newmans, Casts and Dewmans in ARKS, you'd think I'd run into other people more."""
un_020560_0030#0,"""But I don't, it seems I only ever run into you, sir. It seems like destiny, romantic, huh? Haha."""
un_020560_0040#0,"""It's like reading the history or ARKS, there's more than just a few fortunate coincidences."""
un_020560_0050#0,"""The origins of Dewmans is also similar in that effect."""
un_020560_0060#0,"""I don't know how long ago this was but, suddenly, remains of a life form came out of nowhere."""
un_020560_0070#0,"""That's how it's recorded at least, but I can't imagine something so convenient happening."""
un_020560_0080#0,"""It had scales like a dragon and was similar to Darkers, and based on that, they did experiments."""
un_020560_0090#0,"""And the results of those experiments are us."""
un_020560_0100#0,"""That and this is just between us."""
un_020560_0110#0,"""But it seems that those remains were very similar to the dragon that went rampaging."""
un_020560_0120#0,"""Seems like a really odd coincidence, wouldn't you agree?"""
un_020560_0130#0,"""But I guess without that, I wouldn't exist, so I can't complain."""
