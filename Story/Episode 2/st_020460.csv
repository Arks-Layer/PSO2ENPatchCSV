st_020460_0010#0,"""Hm... We've been walking for a while. I wonder if this is the right way."""
st_020460_0020#0,"""It's just like that idiot Xiao. If he can't be in contact, he should have at least drawn a map or something."""
st_020460_0030#0,"""Oh? Hey, it's you! What are you doing in a place like this?"""
st_020460_0040#0,"""You're with a different girl today. You have more experience than you let on."""
st_020460_0050#0,"""What? Directions to the back of this place? Just head to that direction."""
st_020460_0060#0,"""I've never really come down here, but I can somehow tell. Maybe it's a sense I have being from here."""
st_020460_0070#0,"""Anyways, see you later."""
st_020460_0080#0,"""What was that? A native to this planet? But why could we understand it?"""
st_020460_0090#0,"""You could understand him to begin with? How could that be if ARKS have never set foot on this planet before?"""
st_020460_0100#0,"""That only leaves the possibility that it was somehow artificially created here by ARKS."""
st_020460_0110#0,"""And in ARKS, there's only one person that could be."""
st_020460_0120#0,"""I don't need to confirm this with Xiao. Luther is definitely doing something sinister here."""
