un_020570_0010#0,"""Oh, hello, <%me>."""
un_020570_0020#0,"""I tried looking into the research division like the Professor suggested."""
un_020570_0030#0,"""Void, it seems like they conduct experiments to improve ARKS. Or that's what they say on the outside."""
un_020570_0040#0,"""After successful research is put into effect, they move on to the next. From concept to reality, as it were."""
un_020570_0050#0,"""But in order to do so, they use any means available to them, that includes experimenting on people."""
un_020570_0060#0,"""And not just Dewmans, but all of the other races up until now and the Rampaging Dragon incident was them as well."""
un_020570_0070#0,"""That's why the Professor always talked about living things being so important to her."""
un_020570_0080#0,"""She knew I was a spy and kept saying things like that, so I could find out the truth on my own."""
un_020570_0090#0,"""She really is an odd person, never saying anything outright, always speaking through actions."""
un_020570_0100#0,"""All she needed to do was ask me to go along with her and I would have in a heart beat."""
un_020570_0110#0,"""Haha, by the way, everything I said just now is top secret."""
un_020570_0120#0,"""If it got out that I found this information, both me and the Professor would disappear in an instant."""
un_020570_0130#0,"""But thanks for listening. Somehow, I feel relieved."""
