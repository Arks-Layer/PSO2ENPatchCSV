st_020120_0010#0,"""Oh, <%me>. It's been a while."""
st_020120_0020#0,"""I'm concealing myself at the moment, but you seem to be able to see right though it."""
st_020120_0030#0,"""<%me>? What are you doing, talking into thin air like that?"""
st_020120_0040#0,"""See, that's the appropriate response. Anyways, it's not like I'm on a mission or anything."""
st_020120_0050#0,"""I saw you during the rampaging dragon incident.... Were you masking your presence just now?!"""
st_020120_0060#0,"""Gathering photons and then masking your presence... This is the ability of the Genesis, the Translucent Blade Mai!"""
st_020120_0070#0,"""I see you're well informed."""
st_020120_0080#0,"""Do you even know what you're doing to yourself by using those? It consumes a massive amount of photons."""
st_020120_0090#0,"""I don't need a lecture. This is how I've managed to survive in a world that forces me to do this."""
st_020120_0100#0,"""Of course, I don't plan on dying anytime soon. I made a promise with him..."""
st_020120_0110#0,"""But I'm still nowhere close, I can't see a clear solution, and I always end up back here."""
st_020120_0120#0,"""I thought maybe Hadred might still be here."""
st_020120_0130#0,"""I've heard that even if Dragonkin die, their souls return here. What you said just now may not be entirely incorrect."""
st_020120_0140#0,"""So Hadred might still be...!?"""
st_020120_0150#0,"""However, that only applies to Dragonkin. I'm not sure if that applies to artificial Dragons created by ARKS."""
st_020120_0160#0,"""You really seem to know what you're talking about. You knew about my Mai blades as well."""
st_020120_0170#0,"""That's to be expected. My research was used in making Hadred after all."""
st_020120_0180#0,"""Explain yourself."""
st_020120_0190#0,"""I understand you want to know. And you have the right to ask."""
st_020120_0200#0,"""But first, the situation. Let's get moving, I'll explain everything I know along the way."""
st_020120_0210#0,"""I understand. Since you're with <%me>, I'll trust you."""
st_020120_0220#0,"""But if I hear something I don't like..."""
st_020120_0230#0,"""I'm a researcher. I'm already prepared to be hated and targeted for what I've done."""
