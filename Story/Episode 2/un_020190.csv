un_020190_0010#0,"""Hello, hello, Patty here!"""
un_020190_0020#0,"""I feel like I've introduced myself like this before."""
un_020190_0030#0,"""I really don't think anyone cares, Tea here."""
un_020190_0040#0,"""That aside, we managed to investigate that thing you were curious about!"""
un_020190_0050#0,"""You don't remember, uh \""that\""!? That super dangerous thingy-ma-thing!"""
un_020190_0060#0,"""Claris Claes' weapon, the Clarisa."""
un_020190_0070#0,"""Right! The Genesis rod, the White Tin Clarisa!"""
un_020190_0075#0,"""You were curious about it, right? Anyway, it doesn't matter, we looked into it anyway!"""
un_020190_0080#0,"""It has a lovely looking white snow frame to it that shines when you touch it. Wait, was it white?"""
un_020190_0090#0,"""Isn't that what you went to investigate in the first place? I'll take it from here, Patty."""
un_020190_0100#0,"""About the Clarisa, it seems that it was lost ten years ago."""
un_020190_0110#0,"""That's why the weapon the current Clarisa is carrying is a fake."""
un_020190_0120#0,"""Even though it's not the original, it still has immense power. Not something you'd want to be on the receiving end of."""
un_020190_0130#0,"""Even among the Genesis weapons, the Clarrisa is special. Like it chooses someone with a certain level of ability..."""
un_020190_0140#0,"""The rod chooses who's able to use it? It's almost like it's alive. That would explain why she talks to it!"""
un_020190_0150#0,"""... You're right, it's not uncommon to hear rumors of Clarrisa talking to her weapon."""
un_020190_0160#0,"""\""Give me power, more power, did you hear me?\"", or something like that?"""
un_020190_0170#0,"""Why did you make her sound so condescending?"""
un_020190_0180#0,"""Because Clarisa Claes sounds like that."""
un_020190_0190#0,"""Can't argue with you there..."""
