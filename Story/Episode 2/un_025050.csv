un_025050_0020#0,"""What's the matter, Quna? Lost your nerve?"""
un_025050_0030#0,"""...I'm not in the mood. Next time."""
un_025050_0040#0,"""Looks like you granted her the perfect excuse to escape, <%me>."""
un_025050_0050#0,"""...keep running your lips, and I'll help you shut up... permanently."""
un_025050_0060#0,"""Haha, it's a joke. With Luther gone, I'm not in a hurry to die anymore."""
un_025050_0070#0,"""...explain."""
un_025050_0080#0,"""The Photoners are an ancient race. Even with their advanced technology, it would be impossible to maintain their original bodies from that era."""
un_025050_0090#0,"""The logical question, then, is where did Luther get his body from?"""
un_025050_0100#0,"""...the answer is right here. He slipped in and out of the bodies of ARKS."""
un_025050_0110#0,"""When his current body started to fail, he'd move on to the next... much like Dark Falz."""
un_025050_0120#0,"""Ah the irony... that he turned out to be a Dark Falz in the end."""
un_025050_0125#0,"""Are you, too, one of us? An artificial creation?"""
un_025050_0130#0,"""That's right. I'm one of the first Casra type clones, modeled after the late hero, from the early experiments."""
un_025050_0140#0,"""The reason we weren't mass produced like the Claris Claes type was, well... we're not very cooperative."""
un_025050_0150#0,"""The original Casra always had a rebellious streak to him, so Luther had to take direct control, or so I heard."""
un_025050_0160#0,"""Ah, but please don't misunderstand me. I'm not appealing to your sympathy just because we share a similar past."""
un_025050_0170#0,"""I was the one who devised the Biosynthetic Dragon Project. That makes me the rightful target of your revenge, Lady Quna."""
un_025050_0180#0,"""I am further responsible for failing to foresee Luther's actions, and thereby permitting those inhuman experiments, however indirectly."""
un_025050_0190#0,"""...Hero Casra. Why did you not conceal the intel regarding the man-made dragon?"""
un_025050_0200#0,"""Your M.O. is to secretly dispose of such data, and yet, when you were in control you leaked\u3000it all, including the classified experiments..."""
un_025050_0210#0,"""It's as if you intended to expose its dark secrets... why would you do such a thing?"""
un_025050_0220#0,"""Hmm, I don't know what came over me."""
un_025050_0230#0,"""...You really get on my nerves."""
un_025050_0240#0,"""Well then, it looks like I get to live another day."""
un_025050_0250#0,"""1. Was all of that really true?"""
un_025050_0260#0,"""2. Don't you think you went a little too far?"""
un_025050_0270#0,"""Who can say? I'll leave it up to your imagination to decide truth from fiction."""
un_025050_0280#0,"""You think so? But I was being fairly serious."""
un_025050_0290#0,"""But I suppose I may have said a bit much. For some reason, I loosen up around you.  It's a real problem."""
un_025050_0300#0,"""Now if you'll excuse me, I'd best be off before I blurt out something else I shouldn't. Cheers."""
