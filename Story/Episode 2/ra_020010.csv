ra_020010_0010#0,"""Thank you for coming. There's something occurring on the time axis that I wanted to talk to you about."""
ra_020010_0020#0,"""According to my analysis, this is the place."""
ra_020010_0030#0,"""Can you hear me, Xion? At last, I was able to track you down to here."""
ra_020010_0040#0,"""It seems there is a lot of movement. I didn't expect the appearance of a new type, the Dewmans though."""
ra_020010_0060#0,"""I suppose it's the result of intervening with history."""
ra_020010_0070#0,"""Well, it's not like I'm angry. I wouldn't want to pick a fight with you."""
ra_020010_0080#0,"""Heheh... Though I'm still unable to see you."""
ra_020010_0090#0,"""I want, so much, to understand you... but I suppose you just aren't ready yet."""
ra_020010_0100#0,"""Well, I don't want to spoil your mood. I shall excuse myself for today."""
ra_020010_0110#0,"""How was that? Was she listening?"""
ra_020010_0113#0,"""I really should thank you. Because of you, I've been able to gain some understanding of her."""
ra_020010_0116#0,"""Why she does some things and not others... It's fascinating to watch."""
ra_020010_0120#0,"""My name is Luther. I'm the head of the Research Division...<br>Or to give it its true name, the Void Facility."""
ra_020010_0130#0,"""Well then, until we meet again."""
ra_020010_0140#0,"""He cannot see me. He cannot even hear my voice. And yet, he is aware of my presence."""
ra_020010_0150#0,"""He is the reason I have entrusted everything to you."""
ra_020010_0160#0,"""I do not want to trust fate to him."""
ra_020010_0170#0,"""But... The reason he became warped is because I also exist."""
ra_020010_0180#0,"""The origin of that curiosity is my greatest regret. That is why I entrust everything to you."""
ra_020010_0190#0,"""So that's Luther... Leader of the Photoners."""
ra_020010_0200#0,"""Technically correct, but it would be more accurate to call him the only Photoner."""
ra_020010_0205#0,"""All the others who go by that name merely wish to become Photoners. But it is beyond their reach."""
ra_020010_0210#0,"""When [Elder]'s seal was broken, the artificial dragon was able to break free. The one who was behind it had become impatient, and overplayed their hand."""
ra_020010_0220#0,"""But the first to make contact with the enemy was that person... I wonder why."""
ra_020010_0230#0,"""I don't care about that. I only want to destroy the monster who ruined my life and Hadred's."""
ra_020010_0240#0,"""Quna, <%me> is the key.<br>You understand that, yes?"""
ra_020010_0250#0,"""I'll fight my own way. I have no intention of working with you, Casra of the Council... of the Three Heroes."""
ra_020010_0260#0,"""Besides, you know the position that you're in, don't you."""
ra_020010_0270#0,"""Yes, I know, Quna. When all this is over, my life is in your hands, for you to do as you will."""
ra_020010_0280#0,"""That was our agreement. As long as you bear this risk, I will keep my promise."""
ra_020010_0290#0,"""I really hate that face of yours. Just what are you after?"""
ra_020010_0300#0,"""At present, the same as yourself."""
ra_020010_0310#0,"""Hm."""
ra_020010_0320#0,"""I've obeyed you this far. But now, Luther..."""
ra_020010_0330#0,"""???"""
