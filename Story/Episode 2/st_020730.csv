st_020730_0010#0,"""The Photoners were not evil. Looking at their actions, they should be called common occurrences in evolution."""
st_020730_0020#0,"""If the Photoners weren't around, the Darkers most likely wouldn't be either. But then, the ARKS wouldn't exist either."""
st_020730_0030#0,"""Yes, the Photoners were greedy, brimming with curiosity, moderately lazy, arrogant... righteous people."""
st_020730_0040#0,"""No longer being an observer and teaching them knowledge of Photons... What I did... was wrong."""
st_020730_0050#0,"""...but, I was lonely."""
st_020730_0060#0,"""It's a conclusion I find hard to understand."""
st_020730_0070#0,"""That can't be. Xion, you should understand."""
st_020730_0080#0,"""I... I was lonely. Scared, and in pain. I wished to be saved by someone."""

st_020730_0110#0,"""Xion, you're the same. When you met the Photoners, you were delighted. Being alone, must have been so lonely..."""
st_020730_0120#0,"""Yes. Xion, you must have been lonely."""
st_020730_0130#0,"""...You... it can't be... Are you... my relative... or my memories...?"""
st_020730_0140#0,"""No, I can feel them. Your emotions, I can feel them."""
st_020730_0150#0,"""You were lonely, so you called out. There's nothing wrong with that."""
st_020730_0160#0,"""What went wrong happened afterwards. Xion, you also think that."""
st_020730_0170#0,"""That's why, in order to fix it, you let <%me> and I meet you, right?"""
st_020730_0180#0,"""...Ah, that's what it was. That emotion I had at the very beginning. That was... loneliness."""
