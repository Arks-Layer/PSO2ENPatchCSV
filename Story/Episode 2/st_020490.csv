st_020490_0010#0,"""What's gotten into you? There's no way that enemy is a threat to us in that state."""
st_020490_0020#0,"""Hm... Looks like everything here has already been taken out as well. Looks like someone got here before us."""
st_020490_0030#0,"""Forgive me, Theodore, I had intended this to be a test of your new powers. It seems that will need to wait."""
st_020490_0040#0,"""No need for concern on my part. More importantly, should I do that here as well?"""
st_020490_0050#0,"""By all means."""
st_020490_0060#0,"""Splendid. In that state, there's no way to extract any considerable amount of data."""
st_020490_0070#0,"""Would you like me to blow the entire thing to pieces?"""
st_020490_0080#0,"""No need to go to such lengths. Honestly, it's not even essential to destroy it at all."""
st_020490_0090#0,"""It doesn't matter what they investigate or discover, there's nothing ARKS can do."""
st_020490_0100#0,"""Well, aside from dancing around in the palm of my hand."""
st_020490_0110#0,"""Going to the extent of taking away their ability to dance would make this exercise rather boring."""
st_020490_0120#0,"""The data is complete. It's already too late, so I find their futile attempts to resist so very amusing."""
st_020490_0130#0,"""I don't completely understand..."""
st_020490_0140#0,"""In time, you will. Let's go, shall we?"""
st_020490_0150#0,"""That was a close call..."""
st_020490_0160#0,"""My apologies, but I have no intention of dancing in your palm. While you're laughing, we'll take you down."""
st_020490_0170#0,"""But one thing I don't understand. That ARKS with him definitely wasn't Clarrisa Kliess, so who was it?"""
st_020490_0180#0,"""It poses a problem if we have to confront him as an enemy sometime in the future."""
st_020490_0190#0,"""Simply being used and then thrown away when not needed, we need to break that cycle."""
st_020490_0200#0,"""For it to happen to me is already..."""
st_020490_0205#0,"""Forget I said anything just now."""
st_020490_0210#0,"""I wonder if there's any way to emancipate him from Luther's grasp."""
