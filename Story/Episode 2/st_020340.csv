st_020340_0010#0,"""That's odd. This area should be where the Lillipans live, but I don't see them anywhere."""
st_020340_0020#0,"""It's not here either. I thought I held back enough, but this structure was too weak."""
st_020340_0030#0,"""Someone not even knowing where their own body is, sounds like a bad joke."""
st_020340_0040#0,"""Oh, you're the ARKS who was able to defeat Elder. I see you're still not dead yet."""
st_020340_0050#0,"""Y-you, what are you doing here!?"""
st_020340_0060#0,"""This is where the Lillipans live. Doing rash things like that will put them in danger!"""
st_020340_0070#0,"""Lillipans? You mean those little guys? Does it really look like I care?"""
st_020340_0080#0,"""Don't be fooled by her appearance, she's not ARKS."""
st_020340_0090#0,"""Running into Elder, and now you, I have really bad luck recently."""
st_020340_0100#0,"""How long has it been, ten years? You seem to have gotten cuter, haven't you, [Apprentice]?"""
st_020340_0110#0,"""Getting up in arms over nothing. I don't think I've done anything to give you reason to attack me."""
st_020340_0120#0,"""... Oh, that's right, ARKS don't need a reason, do you?"""
st_020340_0130#0,"""The basic premise of ARKS is simply to kill Darkers."""
st_020340_0140#0,"""I kill things that I don't like, and you kill Darkers."""
st_020340_0150#0,"""I suppose that maybe, our way of thinking may not be too different, don't you think?"""
st_020340_0160#0,"""That's not it! We only fight Darkers to try and protect the universe!"""
st_020340_0170#0,"""Don't waste your breath trying to reason. """
st_020340_0180#0,"""We're ARKS, and they're Darkers. That's all there is to it."""
st_020340_0190#0,"""Pretty much. But I don't have any time to waste with you at the moment."""
st_020340_0200#0,"""Oh, a guard robot. Maybe I blew up too much?"""
st_020340_0210#0,"""But it seems like a good opportunity. It can't tell the difference between ARKS and Darkers."""
st_020340_0220#0,"""I'll let you deal with the guard robot. Later."""
