un_020490_0010#0,"""It doesn't matter how good you're feeling, there's still things you shouldn't do!"""
un_020490_0020#0,"""You came at just the right time. <%me>, can you help me tell her off?"""
un_020490_0030#0,"""Please, I'm really sorry. I won't do it again."""
un_020490_0040#0,"""What did she do? She used Techniques inside the city."""
un_020490_0050#0,"""\""Hey, look at this,\"" she says, and then, bam! Out of nowhere she casts a technic!"""
un_020490_0060#0,"""S-Sorry! I thought I might be able to do one so I tried! I didn't mean anything bad by it!"""
un_020490_0070#0,"""Of course! If you had, I would have reported you for it!"""
un_020490_0080#0,"""Uh, I really am sorry!"""
un_020490_0090#0,"""Any use of Techniques inside the city is normally cancelled out."""
un_020490_0100#0,"""Even so, Matoi was able to cast one without even using a rod."""
un_020490_0110#0,"""Unbelievable, I've never even heard of anything like this."""
un_020490_0120#0,"""It's good that she wasn't seen by anyone, otherwise, we'd have an incident on our hands."""
un_020490_0130#0,"""What are you two whispering about?"""
un_020490_0140#0,"""What, your punishment is going to be."""
un_020490_0150#0,"""What? Did I really do something that bad?"""
un_020490_0160#0,"""Can you stop pouting like a child?"""
un_020490_0170#0,"""Anyway, if you want to use Techniques, then we're going to have to prepare a way for you to practice."""
un_020490_0180#0,"""So never, ever, ever do something like that again. Understood?"""
un_020490_0190#0,"""Uh, yes...."""
un_020490_0200#0,"""Rather than trying to hide it, I think it's best if she understood her abilities."""
un_020490_0210#0,"""Also, she's a peculiar case. I don't think others would stay quiet if they found out."""
un_020490_0220#0,"""It might hold back her potential, but we should make her use a tool for fighting."""
un_020490_0230#0,"""And all of this stays between us."""
