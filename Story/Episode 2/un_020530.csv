un_020530_0020#0,"""Sorry, I'm in the middle of training and I'm a little wound up!"""
un_020530_0030#0,"""Don't worry, Fourier, you can do that three time before people start to catch on."""
un_020530_0040#0,"""What are you talking about? With launchers, I always get yelled at if I mess up once..."""
un_020530_0050#0,"""Really? Launchers are like that? I wonder if the standards depend on the weapon."""
un_020530_0060#0,"""What are we doing? Just what it looks like, partner training with Lisa!"""
un_020530_0070#0,"""Fufu, an all Ranger party is great. You can shoot all you want and no one complains!"""
un_020530_0080#0,"""Yes, I can blow up everything I want without anyone getting caught in it!"""
un_020530_0090#0,"""Because of this, it's really easy for Rangers to get along."""
un_020530_0100#0,"""I agree! The way we fight and the way we think is really similar!"""
un_020530_0110#0,"""The only difference seems to be that Fourier uses the launcher as her main weapon."""

un_020530_0130#0,"""I have to recommend launchers. It's refreshing to blow things up!"""
un_020530_0140#0,"""Fourier, don't you think we should get going soon?"""
un_020530_0150#0,"""Let's have a lot more fun to shoot, shoot, and kill, kill, kill things."""
un_020530_0160#0,"""Yes! Let's blow up everything we see!"""
