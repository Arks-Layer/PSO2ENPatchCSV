st_020630_0010#0,"""Ha... ha.. as expected of you, <%me>... but... I'll kill you..."""
st_020630_0020#0,"""...As your opponent, I know it well. Your strength...but... I have to kill you."""
st_020630_0030#0,"""Four people down in this sorry state... Lisa is losing her confidence. Right? Right right?"""
st_020630_0040#0,"""..."""
st_020630_0050#0,"""...I don't get it. I really don't get it!"""
st_020630_0060#0,"""Why do we have to fight these people we were laughing with just before?"""
st_020630_0070#0,"""If that's an order... that order is really strange!"""
st_020630_0080#0,"""...Yes, that's right. That command, it's weird."""
st_020630_0090#0,"""Why, didn't I... realize that?"""
st_020630_0100#0,"""Fourier?"""
st_020630_0110#0,"""I... I am... What am I doing? No, I remember the battle but that... was me?"""
st_020630_0120#0,"""...It was like there was another me inside of me... I couldn't disobey it... myself..."""
st_020630_0130#0,"""Hmmm... If I had to put it into words, it was like a lucid dream, and it feels like I've returned to reality. Yeah."""
st_020630_0140#0,"""Well, the dream as a dream was pretty fun, and Lisa is pretty satisfied, but if everyone's stopping, so will I."""
st_020630_0150#0,"""Also, if we keep at it, those guys over there seem to want to join in."""
st_020630_0160#0,"""......Darkers! Why are they here?"""
st_020630_0170#0,"""Emergency transmission to all ARKS! Darkers have taken advantage of the chaos to attack!"""
st_020630_0180#0,"""They've breached the last defensive line and are invading the Mothership! Annihilate them, along with the traitor!"""
st_020630_0190#0,"""They breached the last defensive line!?"""
st_020630_0200#0,"""That's never been breached up until now, but it was so easily...?"""
st_020630_0210#0,"""We were so obsessed with the traitor that we became careless."""
st_020630_0220#0,"""Hah, really. They're making more and more, stupider and stupider, charming mistakes. I'm going to fall in love, you know."""
st_020630_0230#0,"""Aside from that, we need to consider the remaining Darkers and siding with the traitor. ...We can't make an honest judgement, huh?"""
st_020630_0240#0,"""<%me>! Go, go ahead!"""
st_020630_0250#0,"""What's right and what's wrong, I don't... I don't know anymore."""

st_020630_0300#0,"""...I can't correct the mistake I made, but just this... let me do it."""
st_020630_0310#0,"""Did you know? Lisa hates Darkers more than people."""
st_020630_0320#0,"""Whether it's an order or whatever, Lisa only has one aim, you know?"""
st_020630_0330#0,"""That thing called Abyss only goes this far, huh? No, was it some other power at work? ...Well, whatever."""
st_020630_0340#0,"""It's the words of an unwanted toy. If it lets me see some sort of eccentric activity, that's interesting in its own right."""
st_020630_0350#0,"""Now, ARKS. Darkers. Kill each other as you please. I'll allow you that freedom at least."""
