un_020740_0020#0,"""ARE YOU DOING WELL?!<br>You are, aren't you? Lisa is glad to see you're still alive, you know?"""
un_020740_0030#0,"""Lisa is just taking a comfy stroll. Things aren't very relaxed on the ARKS Ships, after all."""
un_020740_0040#0,"""The tension in the air seems different from how it was during Dark Falz's revival, doesn't it?"""
un_020740_0050#0,"""It's like a tingling sensation, coming from the inside rather than outside. It's quite exciting, isn't it?!"""
un_020740_0060#0,"""It reminds Lisa of a feeling she felt a long, looong time ago."""
un_020740_0070#0,"""Lisa doesn't have the slightest, foggiest clue as to exactly how long ago, though."""
un_020740_0080#0,"""Still though, ahhh still though! Lisa is so jealous, you know? It looks so fun, you know?!"""
un_020740_0090#0,"""Haven't you noticed it? The pokey-tingly sensation that you're at the center of?"""
un_020740_0100#0,"""What could it be, anyways? Ahh, Lisa's so jealous, so jealous! She just wants to shoot, shoot, SHOOT IT ALL TO PIECES!"""
un_020740_0110#0,"""But, but, Lisa knows better than that, so she won't.<br>Don't you worry, okay? Hehehe."""
