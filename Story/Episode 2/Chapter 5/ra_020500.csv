ra_020500_0010#0,"""The victims of the recent Darker invasion of Themis? What do you mean?"""
ra_020500_0015#0,"""The raid of Darkers. You know, that one where even Regius showed up to fight."""
ra_020500_0020#0,"""Oh, that one... That one, huh... Wow, you got a good eye for info."""
ra_020500_0030#0,"""That one Newman boy from earlier asked for the same thing too, you see."""
ra_020500_0040#0,"""But I'm afraid that's a no. We sisters here have things we can and can't do."""
ra_020500_0050#0,"""Patty's incomprehensible babbling aside... That's the same thing Theodore asked of us."""
ra_020500_0060#0,"""But all I have is apologies. Like Patty said, we can't really help you out with that."""
ra_020500_0070#0,"""Even though it's not supposed to be such important info, we keep running into problems..."""
ra_020500_0080#0,"""The victim report for that event's been completely classified. Nobody gets to see it..."""
ra_020500_0090#0,"""We can't find anything using our usual methods, either. Why's that? It just adds to the mystery..."""
ra_020500_0100#0,"""Well, we somehow managed to get a report on those deceased, but it doesn't seem like that's what you're looking for..."""
ra_020500_0110#0,"""But, do not fret! If we can't pull it out electronically, we'll just go by word of mouth!"""
ra_020500_0120#0,"""...Well, that's usually the case, but... do you have any leads, Patty?"""
ra_020500_0130#0,"""Nope!"""
ra_020500_0140#0,"""Yeah, thought so..."""
