un_020620_0040#0,"""There's water everywhere, it's like the entire planet is submerged!"""
un_020620_0050#0,"""It definitely seems like an unusual composition. I wonder if it could have been caused by Darkers?"""
un_020620_0060#0,"""Right, Darkers. It could be. But with Dark Falz around, I'd rather not think about that right now."""
un_020620_0070#0,"""There's a state of emergency in effect. If we get called, then I suppose that takes priority."""
un_020620_0080#0,"""It also seems that for some reason, an ARKS distress signal is coming from this planet."""

un_020620_0100#0,"""In a lot of ways, it seems similar to how Naberius was discovered."""
