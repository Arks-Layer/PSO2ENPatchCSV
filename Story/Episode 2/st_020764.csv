st_020764_0460#0,"""If you had distanced your defiant faces, you might have lived a little longer. Isn't that regrettable?"""
st_020764_0470#0,"""...Why are you doing this? What do you think we are?!"""
st_020764_0480#0,"""What a thing to say. Weren't you ARKS originally the toys of the Photoners?"""
st_020764_0490#0,"""It's not just you guys. Everything in this vast universe is to me... A test site, my playground."""
st_020764_0500#0,"""And when you're done playing with your toys, you toss them aside. Isn't that obvious?"""

st_020764_0550#0,"""Your first sacrifices were useless. In the end, you couldn't protect the ARKS!"""
