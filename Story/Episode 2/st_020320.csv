st_020320_0010#0,"""It's pretty rare that an alert has been issued for all ARKS."""
st_020320_0020#0,"""Makes me remember what happened back on Naberius."""
st_020320_0030#0,"""You don't think that Dark Falz might appear or be revived or something like that?"""
st_020320_0040#0,"""Well, you can handle yourself. I'm worried about what could happen to me in that situation."""
st_020320_0050#0,"""I've heard that the Council of Six have been dispatched as well."""
st_020320_0060#0,"""You heard wrong. The only ones in the Council of Six active are Huey and I at the moment."""
st_020320_0070#0,"""That is to say on the other hand, because the Three Heroes are on standby, everyone is on alert."""
st_020320_0080#0,"""AAAAhhhh! Second in the Council of Six, Maria. What are you doing here?"""
st_020320_0090#0,"""Didn't I just say that I was patrolling a second ago?"""

st_020320_0120#0,"""Are you surprised to see this reaction from me? It's only natural!"""
st_020320_0130#0,"""A female cast and part of the Council of Six, there's no reason for me to not look up to Maria!"""
st_020320_0140#0,"""The Council of Six and the Three Heroes aren't really anything special to look up to."""
st_020320_0150#0,"""What?"""
st_020320_0160#0,"""\""Hero\"", is nothing more than a nice way of rephrasing \""sacrificial lamb\""."""
st_020320_0170#0,"""That aside, since we happened to meet up, why don't we proceed together from here?"""
