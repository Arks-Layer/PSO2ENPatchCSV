ra_020040_0010#0,"""I'm surprised that you haven't given up, Xion. It's not like you to waste your energy on futile endeavors."""
ra_020040_0020#0,"""I have Oracle, and all of ARKS, within my grasp. Even you cannot escape me..."""
ra_020040_0030#0,"""Nothing in this world is futile. You were the one who taught me that."""
ra_020040_0040#0,"""Well, I suppose I don't mind. A few irregularities here and there will certainly make things more interesting."""
ra_020040_0050#0,"""I intend to savour the process of crushing them. Time is a privilege granted to the immortal, after all."""
ra_020040_0060#0,"""It seems you're picking up quite a reputation. Your name has been turning up all over my reports."""
ra_020040_0070#0,"""You may do as you please, as long as you don't get in my way. Watching you struggle helps to break up the ennui."""
ra_020040_0080#0,"""When one has lived for almost an eternity, one sometimes requires a little stimulation. I'm sure you two would agree?"""
ra_020040_0090#0,"""Luther is no longer human. However, you should not forget that he was once a man like any other."""
ra_020040_0100#0,"""...He gets carried away. When he was human, he feared boredom above all else."""
ra_020040_0110#0,"""It was both his greatest strength and his greatest weakness. It would be wise to take advantage of that."""
ra_020040_0120#0,"""That is what I would do, and we have concluded the same. That conclusion should not be in error."""
ra_020040_0130#0,"""You should continue as you believe you must. The path is born in front of you. This is what everyone wishes."""
al_020020_0010#0,"""Oh, Xiao's finally appeared. I see, I see, so that's how you two met."""
al_020020_0020#0,"""Hmm, if that's the case, then that would mean... Hm, would that work...<br>...Oh, sorry."""
al_020020_0030#0,"""Back in the day, I was physically very weak, so my greatest pleasure was reading books and trying to picture the things I was reading about. That's kind of what I was doing just now."""
al_020020_0040#0,"""I was trying to work out why Xion created Xiao, and why she sent him to meet you now, of all times."""
al_020020_0050#0,"""If the idea was to use Xiao's power to help foil Luther's schemes...<br>...I guess the things that have happened so far must have had to happen that way."""
al_020020_0060#0,"""[Elder] being allowed to revive, Theodore getting manipulated, and Luther approaching Xion himself."""
al_020020_0070#0,"""...She must have calculated that if those conditions hadn't been set up, Luther would have realised she was up to something."""
al_020020_0080#0,"""This was the future she decided on after having seen so many others that failed. Making a move any earlier than this would have been pointless."""
al_020020_0090#0,"""[Elder]'s resurrection might not have been stopped, but Zeno was saved. More importantly, Luther doesn't know about it. If you can build up enough things that Luther doesn't know..."""
al_020020_0100#0,"""...That must lead to Xion's ultimate plan. The pieces of that are starting to come together. This is just the first."""
al_020020_0110#0,"""Of course, that doesn't mean your effort before that was wasted."""
al_020020_0120#0,"""Because of all the things you'd done, Sara trusted you, and Ri was willing to help you."""
al_020020_0130#0,"""Where could this all be heading...<br>Let's look at the next record."""
