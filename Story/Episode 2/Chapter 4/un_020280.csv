un_020280_0020#0,"""You might even have a chance at being Regius in the next generation of the Council of Six."""
un_020280_0030#0,"""But more than that, I wonder what value the Council of Six or the Three Heroes holds at all."""
un_020280_0040#0,"""<%me>, do you know why the Three Heroes exist?"""
un_020280_0050#0,"""1．For the survival of ARKS"""
un_020280_0060#0,"""I suppose you're about one third correct."""
un_020280_0070#0,"""2．To destroy all the Darkers"""
un_020280_0080#0,"""Sorry, but that's completely wrong. We don't get dispatched just because a few Darkers appeared."""
un_020280_0090#0,"""The purpose of the Three Heroes is to protect ARKS... or to be more specific, the Mother Ship."""

un_020280_0130#0,"""That what the Three Heroes is."""
un_020280_0140#0,"""If it were decided that ARKS were a threat, then they would become our enemy as well."""
un_020280_0150#0,"""As one of the Heroes, take my advice and don't put your trust in us."""
un_020280_0160#0,"""And my apologies for any misconceptions I may have caused just now."""
un_020280_0170#0,"""That is merely an extreme hypothesis, in reality, a situation like that is not going to occur."""
un_020280_0180#0,"""And to prevent such a situation is why the Council of Six has an even number of members."""
un_020280_0190#0,"""I will leave you with one last word of advice, if something does happen, trust Maria and Huey more than me."""
