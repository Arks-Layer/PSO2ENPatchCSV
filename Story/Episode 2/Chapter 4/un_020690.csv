un_020690_0010#0,"""Hello senpai. What's wrong, is it really that rare to see a Bullet Bow?"""
un_020690_0020#0,"""A little while ago, they were pretty rare, but now that Braver has caught on, that doesn't seem to be the case."""
un_020690_0030#0,"""Which I guess I should mention that I'm a Braver too. Our weapons are this and the katana."""
un_020690_0040#0,"""I tried using the katana, but this weapon seems to suit me better."""
un_020690_0050#0,"""It's the same for you, right, senpai? There are some weapons that are more natural to use than others, right?"""
un_020690_0060#0,"""It would be nice if there was one weapon that could be used in all situations, but that's not realistic."""
un_020690_0070#0,"""I think I need to focus on improving this for now, and then keep training from there."""
un_020690_0080#0,"""Sorry, I have a lot less experience than you. I got a little carried away thinking to myself."""
un_020690_0090#0,"""Forget what I said just now, it's kind of embarrassing now that I think about it..."""
un_020690_0100#0,"""Well, once I get better with this, could you train me with the next weapon, senpai?"""
un_020690_0110#0,"""I heard a rumor that you can use all weapons to their full potential."""
