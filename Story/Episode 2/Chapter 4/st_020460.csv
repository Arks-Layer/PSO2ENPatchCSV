st_020460_0010#0,"""Hm... We've been walking for a while. I wonder if this is the right way."""
st_020460_0020#0,"""It's just like that idiot Xiao. If he can't stay in contact, he should have at least drawn a map or something."""
st_020460_0030#0,"""Eh? Why, it's me ol' mate! What brings ye t'these parts?"""
st_020460_0040#0,"""Brought a different lassie with ye today, 'ave ye? More trouble than they're worth, if y'ask me."""

st_020460_0110#0,"""And in ARKS, there's only one person that could be."""
st_020460_0120#0,"""I don't need to confirm this with Xiao. Luther is definitely doing something sinister here."""
