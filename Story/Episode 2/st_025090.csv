st_025090_0010#0,"""...What you just witnessed was the truth of ten years ago."""
st_025090_0020#0,"""The stand against [Apprentice]. The attack by [Persona]. And on top of all that, how Matoi almost released the accumulated Darkness inside her..."""
st_025090_0030#0,"""In order to stop it, she was willing to go so far as to take her own life..."""
st_025090_0040#0,"""And then there were Xion's thoughts that we heard during your return."""
st_025090_0050#0,"""She didn't just erase all memories of ten years ago to protect Matoi, she... wanted to forget all of it."""
st_025090_0060#0,"""It would seem that Matoi's appearance in our time, a decade later, was our doing..."""
st_025090_0070#0,"""Having been caught up in our return transport, she lost her memories and her photon arts, and was flung to that place."""
st_025090_0075#0,"""Perhaps that was the reason Clarissa shattered and scattered across planets... to places she held memories in."""

st_025090_0110#0,"""The possibility is there... that she may lose control again. And since right now, that isn't yet the case..."""
st_025090_0120#0,"""...this may be the opportune time to finish her. Objectively speaking, of course."""
st_025090_0130#0,"""<%me>? And Xiao? Why the scary look?"""
st_025090_0140#0,"""M-matoi..."""
st_025090_0150#0,"""Hmm?"""
st_025090_0160#0,"""Never mind, it's nothing. Are you feeling any better?"""
st_025090_0170#0,"""Yup! I got Miss Philia's official stamp of approval!"""
st_025090_0180#0,"""Say, it's been too long since we last had a chat."""
