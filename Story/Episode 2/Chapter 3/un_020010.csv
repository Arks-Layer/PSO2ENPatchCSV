un_020010_0020#0,"""With Lisa's intuition, that is. Lately, Lisa's had trouble being able to distinguish between bad guys and good guys."""
un_020010_0030#0,"""Hehehe... Please don't think Lisa's always been like that, okay? She might end up wanting to shoot you."""

un_020010_0050#0,"""Lisa's senses get kinda blurry, you know? Especially when there are Dewman people around, for some reason."""

un_020010_0070#0,"""Lisa could've sworn she's always been careful not to make those kinds of mistakes, though."""
