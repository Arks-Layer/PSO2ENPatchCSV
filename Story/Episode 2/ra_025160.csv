ra_025160_0010#0,"""Isn't it beautiful?"""
ra_025160_0020#0,"""A vast snowscape set against the clear sky. It makes this bitter cold feel comfortable."""
ra_025160_0030#0,"""...Ah. Your face says I'm acting strange. What's wrong with admiring pretty things?"""
ra_025160_0040#0,"""I am a girl, you know! Beautiful scenery touches my heart, too! ...well, maybe not often."""
ra_025160_0050#0,"""Say, how do normal girls react?"""
ra_025160_0060#0,"""1. With a bit more grace."""
ra_025160_0070#0,"""2. Not that much different."""
ra_025160_0080#0,"""Grace, huh... If I behave more modest, will that make me appear more normal?"""
ra_025160_0090#0,"""Aw, you're just being nice to me. You can be honest."""
ra_025160_0100#0,"""I know very well I'm not normal, and I've never resented that fact."""
ra_025160_0110#0,"""Hey, maybe if I act the opposite... I mean, more modestly, would that make me appear more normal?"""
ra_025160_0120#0,"""Ahem. ...Greetings, <%me>. How are you? I'm doing well. I look forward to today's conversation."""
ra_025160_0130#0,"""...why are you so shocked!? I failed, huh. But I can act more elegantly if I try!"""
ra_025160_0140#0,"""Anyway, I'll pass. If I start acting all warm and fuzzy, I feel like I'll lose the will to fight."""
ra_025160_0150#0,"""That kind of behavior suits me better once we've restored peace across the galaxy."""
ra_025160_0160#0,"""Until then, the 'normal girl' act will have to wait. I'll save it for later!"""
