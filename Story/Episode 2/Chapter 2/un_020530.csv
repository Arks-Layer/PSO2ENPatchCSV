un_020530_0020#0,"""I-I'm sorry! I'm in the middle of training right now, so I'm really high-strung!"""
un_020530_0030#0,"""It's alright, Miss Fourier. Anything under three shots can still be ruled accidental."""
un_020530_0040#0,"""Maybe for you, but a mistake is a mistake. A single misfire could get me in a lot of trouble..."""
un_020530_0050#0,"""Is that how it is with Launchers? There must be different rules for each weapon."""
un_020530_0060#0,"""What are we doing? As you might guess, I'm doing teamwork practice with Lisa!"""
un_020530_0070#0,"""Hehe. A party with only Rangers is pretty great, you know? Lisa can shoot all she wants without bothering anyone."""
un_020530_0080#0,"""Indeed! I don't have to worry about anyone being caught up in my explosions!"""
un_020530_0090#0,"""What's more, it's quite easy to get along with like-minded Rangers."""
un_020530_0100#0,"""Agreed! We fight the same way, we think the same way, et cetera!"""
un_020530_0110#0,"""Lisa does think it's rather unfortunate that Miss Fourier mainly uses the Launcher, though."""
un_020530_0120#0,"""It feels amazing to unleash a constant barrage of torment into your enemies with the Assault Rifle, you know?"""
un_020530_0130#0,"""I recommend the Launcher! The explosions are just so cathartic!"""
un_020530_0140#0,"""Anyways, Miss Fourier. Let's keep going, shall we?"""
un_020530_0150#0,"""Let's have fun shooting and blasting and killing and destroying a whole bunch more enemies, okay?!"""
un_020530_0160#0,"""Yes! I'll demolish any obstacles we encounter!"""
