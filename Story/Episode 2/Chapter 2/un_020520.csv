un_020520_0010#0,"""Oh, what's this?! Oh my, hi! Hello! Lisa is doing some teamwork training!"""
un_020520_0020#0,"""...Lisa... Wait."""
un_020520_0030#0,"""You're too late, Miss Marlu! The enemies already got blown to bits and died, you know?"""
un_020520_0040#0,"""...I think Lisa is going too fast. Could you say something to her? Tell her she's running too far ahead."""
un_020520_0050#0,"""No, no, not at all! This is a training drill for Ranger and Force, so Lisa has to be the one to stand out!"""
un_020520_0060#0,"""The Ranger does crowd control, and the Force blows them all up at once. That's how it's normally done, you know?"""
un_020520_0070#0,"""...While that may be true..."""
un_020520_0080#0,"""Still, Lisa ends up killing everything by herself anyways."""
un_020520_0090#0,"""...That could hardly be called training for me."""
un_020520_0100#0,"""On the contrary, on the contrary! Being able to quickly go from battle to battle is what everyone looks for in a Force, you know?"""
un_020520_0110#0,"""But, still, this is nothing compared to how fast Hunters have to be."""
un_020520_0120#0,"""If you move too slowly, you'll end up getting left behind, you know? Are you okay with that?"""
un_020520_0130#0,"""...I'll try a bit harder."""
un_020520_0140#0,"""Hehe. That's the spirit."""
