un_020400_0030#0,"""The Genesis weapon Maria has is known as the Reaper's Axe Labrys, a Partizan type weapon."""
un_020400_0040#0,"""As for it's characteristic, it's extremely brittle. It can break after using it even once."""
un_020400_0050#0,"""Partly, it's because Maria is simply too strong, but the weapon itself wasn't made with durability in mind."""

un_020400_0070#0,"""It releases so many photons in the process, that not only does the weapon break, it damages the user."""
un_020400_0080#0,"""Maria's able to pass it off while quietly laughing, but then again, that probably comes with the territory."""
