un_020510_0010#0,"""Ah... It's you..."""
un_020510_0020#0,"""Sorry, I'm just in the middle of a training drill for Class coordination... But, my partner..."""
un_020510_0030#0,"""Miiister Ohza?<br>Is something the matter?<br>Did you go to sleep?!"""
un_020510_0040#0,"""Come on, Mister Ohza, let's paint the Sanctum red! Lisa's already killed all the bad guys up ahead, you know?"""
un_020510_0050#0,"""Wait, what's this?! He was speaking with you, was he? Well, in that case, Lisa understands."""
un_020510_0060#0,"""Um... Don't you think you're going a little overboard, Lisa?"""
un_020510_0070#0,"""You think so? But enemies are enemies, so we have to ceaselessly wipe them out like the enemies they are."""
un_020510_0080#0,"""Oh, please don't worry! This is a training drill, so Lisa won't accidentally shoot you. Lisa doesn't want to get in trouble for that again."""
un_020510_0090#0,"""So Mr. Ohza, you can just relax and kill all the enemies who get too close to Lisa, you know?"""
un_020510_0100#0,"""Well, that IS an effective way for a Hunter and Ranger to coordinate..."""
un_020510_0110#0,"""So let's go! If you and Lisa don't take lots more of them out, it can hardly be called training, you know?"""
un_020510_0120#0,"""It's just a simple training drill, so our objective isn't to exterminate all the enemies... Though I suppose that idea is lost on her."""
un_020510_0130#0,"""Jeez... At this point, I'd have an easier time training with that annoying Force who shall not be named."""
