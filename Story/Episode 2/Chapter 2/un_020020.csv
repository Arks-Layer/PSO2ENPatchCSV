un_020020_0020#0,"""Lisa's in a bit of a bad mood. Something doesn't sit right with her."""
un_020020_0030#0,"""Have you already met them? Those ARKS imitations...<br>Yeah, those ARKS-wannabe Darkers."""
un_020020_0040#0,"""You thought Lisa would be happy to shoot things that look like people?<br>Well, unfortunately she's not!"""
un_020020_0050#0,"""Because, well, they feel like puppets that only exist just to be killed, don't they? That's no fun at all!"""
un_020020_0060#0,"""Lisa, you know, she wants to fight someone who's truly fighting to survive with their life on the line."""
un_020020_0070#0,"""Those weak-willed Darker puppets don't get Lisa fired up at all. Photons are all about one's strength of will, after all."""
un_020020_0080#0,"""Oh well. They feel kind of fun to shoot in their own way, so Lisa can still enjoy that sensation. Hehehe."""
