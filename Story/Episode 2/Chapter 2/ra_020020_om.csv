ra_020020_0010#0,"""...It seems she has finally come."""
ra_020020_0020#0,"""<%me>...<br>Sorry if I surprised you."""
ra_020020_0030#0,"""You've been looking so caught up in thought lately, I was a little..."""
ra_020020_0040#0,"""...Who is that?"""
ra_020020_0050#0,"""You can see her?"""
ra_020020_0060#0,"""There's no one there."""
ra_020020_0070#0,"""Of course. Um... Is it someone I'm not supposed to see?"""
ra_020020_0080#0,"""But... Isn't there someone wearing white right there?"""
ra_020020_0090#0,"""The fact that she can see me is not a problem. She is different from Luther."""
ra_020020_0100#0,"""Like you, she is one who has a connection to me. It is only natural that she can see me."""
ra_020020_0110#0,"""...It's strange. I don't think I know you, and yet for some reason, I feel so nostalgic."""
ra_020020_0120#0,"""You don't have to think about it just yet. When the time comes, you will understand everything."""
ra_020020_0130#0,"""...I see. I'm not sure exactly what you mean, but I trust your opinion."""
ra_020020_0140#0,"""You trust me again?<br>...You can still trust me, after all that has happened?"""
ra_020020_0150#0,"""Yep, I trust you.<br><%me> trusts you, so I do too."""
ra_020020_0160#0,"""I must offer you my thanks. Because you saved her at that time and that place, this has come to pass."""
ra_020020_0170#0,"""In time, that act will become the key to the future. What happens afterwards, only time may tell..."""
ra_020020_0180#0,"""But more importantly than that..."""
ra_020020_0190#0,"""Thank you. Thank you for saving her."""
ra_020020_0200#0,"""It's like she's there, and yet she's not there. It's hard to understand."""
ra_020020_0210#0,"""But I got a very warm feeling from her. It felt like when I first met you."""
ra_020020_0220#0,"""It seems you're involved in something very difficult, and this might add to that."""
ra_020020_0230#0,"""But please don't forget that I trust you, and I'll always be there for you."""
al_020010_0010#0,"""This newly discovered planet, Wopal. With all that water, it seems like a beautiful world...<br>...But I get this strange feeling about it."""
al_020010_0020#0,"""The enemies that attacked you, the natives you met, even the planet's climate. It all just feels... artificial."""
al_020010_0030#0,"""There must be some reason why you can talk to those natives without any need for translation, mustn't there? Hmm, this all smells very fishy..."""
al_020010_0040#0,"""Speaking of fishy, Luther showed up again. I see he's still as deceitful and manipulative as ever."""
al_020010_0050#0,"""It's a shame that this is just a replay of what happened. I'd like to give him a piece of my mind!"""
al_020010_0060#0,"""As for Theodore, he doesn't seem to think much of other ARKS. What'll happen to him after this?"""
al_020010_0070#0,"""It looks like Xion is finally able to intervene now. Is that because she made contact with Second?"""
al_020010_0080#0,"""And how was Second already able to see Xion? Does that mean they had a connection even back then?"""
al_020010_0090#0,"""Hm, this is all very worrying. I think we need to see more. Let's keep looking through the records."""
