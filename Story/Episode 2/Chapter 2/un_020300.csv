un_020300_0020#0,"""I don't know how many times, but I've been doing a lot of stealth missions. I should be perfect at concealing myself by now."""
un_020300_0030#0,"""For an idol to completely conceal herself is not an easy task. I'll just say being famous isn't easy."""
un_020300_0040#0,"""Hm? The reason I continue to be an idol? For assurance, is there any other reason?"""
un_020300_0050#0,"""In my profession, it's really not unusual for people to simply be erased, right?"""
un_020300_0060#0,"""That's why I thought that if I continue getting famous as an idol, then it might be harder to erase me."""
un_020300_0070#0,"""My profession may be stealth, but I'd rather not simply disappear."""
un_020300_0080#0,"""That and, because I'm using the Mai blades, it's especially easy for me to be forgotten by everyone."""
un_020300_0090#0,"""That's why I thought that if I do my best as an idol, that even if I die, everyone might remember me."""
un_020300_0100#0,"""Movements are like that, they pick up swiftly and then are completely forgotten."""
un_020300_0110#0,"""But that's okay, if I can do even something that everyone remembers, then I'm okay. That's why I'm doing my best as an idol."""
