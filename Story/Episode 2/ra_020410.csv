ra_020410_0020#0,"""I've been searching the facility around this area, but there doesn't seem to be any clues."""

ra_020410_0060#0,"""The way ARKS use the word \""alert\"" is misleading. It's more correct to say, \""Luther is on alert\""."""
ra_020410_0070#0,"""Apparently, he's not just on alert, but active in this area. I wonder what he's up to."""
