un_020140_0020#0,"""Speaking of which, have you heard of this kind of weapon?"""
un_020140_0030#0,"""This is a katana. It's the type of weapon that Regius, Head of the Three Hero's is most proficient with."""
un_020140_0040#0,"""It seems that Regius has finally decided to start teaching it to lower level ARKS."""
un_020140_0050#0,"""It other words, straight from Regius himself. I'm not at the ability where that's something I can be proud of yet."""
un_020140_0060#0,"""Alright, I'll teach you one special quality about the katana."""
un_020140_0070#0,"""For the weapon type the most important thing, is um, timing."""
un_020140_0080#0,"""Take a deep breath and then cut everything at one. Time with your breathing, and bring your attack together."""
un_020140_0090#0,"""...Or something like that. It's not something I can teach you, it takes a lot of practice."""
un_020140_0100#0,"""If you don't have your breathing right, then your attack is off and your katana might as well be a pillow."""
un_020140_0110#0,"""But once you understand that, the attack potential is incomparable. Anyways, you should try it."""
