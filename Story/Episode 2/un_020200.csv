un_020200_0020#0,"""Today, we have some fresh information for you, and guess what? It's free!"""
un_020200_0030#0,"""We never make any money off our information \""business\"", I should go solo."""

un_020200_0060#0,"""Information is something that only gains value once passed onto someone."""
un_020200_0070#0,"""And more importantly, this time we looked into the Genesis weapons!"""
un_020200_0080#0,"""We were too intrigued about the Clarrisa we talked about last time."""
un_020200_0090#0,"""This time, the target was Regius' weapon, the \""World Ender\""!"""

un_020200_0140#0,"""Which is also how he's registered it as a sword and used it."""
un_020200_0150#0,"""No one knows its real form. If it's unsealed, the world will end, and thus its name."""
un_020200_0160#0,"""T-That seems pretty extravagant! An entire planet in a single blow?"""
un_020200_0170#0,"""Seriously, just who would be crazy enough to make a weapon like that?"""
un_020200_0180#0,"""... It really would be worth looking into."""
