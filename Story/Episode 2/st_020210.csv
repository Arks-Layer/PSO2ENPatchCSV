st_020210_0010#0,"""The two of you have a lot of nerve, pulling the second in the council of six around like this."""
st_020210_0020#0,"""I think it's about time you explained what we're doing here."""
st_020210_0030#0,"""I was just ordered by Xiao to come here. All he said was that if you go there, there'd be reinforcements."""
st_020210_0040#0,"""I'm pretty sure that's how it is for <%me> as well. He didn't say anything specific, right?"""
st_020210_0050#0,"""So there's something that we need to do, but you don't think we're already too late?"""
st_020210_0060#0,"""Judging from this massive Darker reaction, it seems that the seal on Dark Falz has already been broken."""
st_020210_0070#0,"""It seems the seal is something that needs to be broken."""
st_020210_0080#0,"""Unless that happens, Luther won't come out into the open."""
st_020210_0090#0,"""Xiao, you should say something like that a lot sooner! Are you even taking this seriously?"""
st_020210_0100#0,"""What? You're one to talk! You really want to start something right now?"""
st_020210_0110#0,"""Since Sara seems to be caught up with fighting, what do you think about all of this?"""
st_020210_0120#0,"""If our objective isn't to stop Dark Falz's revival, then exactly what is our purpose for being here?"""
st_020210_0130#0,"""1. To defeat Dark Falz"""
st_020210_0140#0,"""2. To rescue ARKS"""
st_020210_0150#0,"""Defeating him now seems like quite a feat. Although, he is weak..."""
st_020210_0160#0,"""If we strike now, we may stand a chance."""
st_020210_0170#0,"""I see, so we're supposed to save the ARKS members he's in combat with."""
st_020210_0180#0,"""Something to that extent definitely seems manageable."""
st_020210_0190#0,"""Well, either way, if we're going to do one or the other, we don't have a lot of time."""
st_020210_0200#0,"""Sara, stop with your fighting. Let's hurry up and get going!"""
st_020210_0210#0,"""Ah, uh, what? Look, you you did, I got yelled at!"""
st_020210_0220#0,"""I got yelled at... stupid Xiao!"""
