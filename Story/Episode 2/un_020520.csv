un_020520_0020#0,""".... Lisa... wait."""
un_020520_0030#0,"""You're late, Marlu. Lisa had already shot all of the enemies in this area into bits and pieces."""
un_020520_0040#0,"""...That's because Lisa is too fast. You don't say anything and you keep pressing on too far ahead."""
un_020520_0050#0,"""That's not it at all. Since this is training with Force and Ranger, then Lisa needs to stand out a little."""
un_020520_0060#0,"""Rangers lock down a group of enemies while Forces finish them off with one attack. This is how it's supposed to be."""
un_020520_0070#0,"""That's true but..."""
un_020520_0080#0,"""Well, Lisa is getting a little carried away and killing everything."""
un_020520_0090#0,"""That doesn't do anything in terms of my training."""
un_020520_0100#0,"""That doesn't matter. Do you think that being this slow, you can show your face in front of other Forces?"""
un_020520_0110#0,"""But if you pair with a Hunter, the pace shouldn't be too different from this."""
un_020520_0120#0,"""If you're too slow in general, then you'll just get left behind. Are you okay with that?"""
un_020520_0130#0,"""I'll try a little harder."""
un_020520_0140#0,"""Fufu, that's the spirit."""
