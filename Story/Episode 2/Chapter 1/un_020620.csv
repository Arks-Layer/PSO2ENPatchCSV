un_020620_0020#0,"""Was that display supposed to accomplish something? Hello, Tia here."""
un_020620_0030#0,"""We finally get a chance to check out a new planet!"""
un_020620_0040#0,"""There's water everywhere, it's like the entire planet is submerged!"""
un_020620_0050#0,"""It definitely seems like an unusual composition. I wonder if it could have been caused by Darkers?"""
un_020620_0060#0,"""Right, Darkers. It could be. But with Dark Falz around, I'd rather not think about that right now."""
un_020620_0070#0,"""There's a state of emergency in effect. If we get called, then I suppose that takes priority."""
un_020620_0080#0,"""It also seems that for some reason, an ARKS distress signal is coming from this planet."""
un_020620_0090#0,"""That's right! I wonder why a distress signal would be coming from a place like this?"""
un_020620_0100#0,"""In a lot of ways, it seems similar to how Naberius was discovered."""
un_020620_0110#0,"""Yeah. Normally, a dispatch order would only be issued to a few ARKS at a time, but this time it went out to everyone."""
un_020620_0120#0,"""Well, we're still investigating, and the native creatures seems pretty violent. Take care!"""
