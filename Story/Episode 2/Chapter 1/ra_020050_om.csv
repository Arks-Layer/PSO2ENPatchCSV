ra_020050_0010#0,"""...I would like to tell you a story. A story of a foolish \""thing\"" and a foolish \""person\""."""
ra_020050_0020#0,"""Our story begins when the \""thing\"" that knew all things met a \""person\"" who held an interest in all things."""
ra_020050_0030#0,"""The \""thing\"" granted the wish of the \""person\"", bestowing wisdom and knowledge."""
ra_020050_0040#0,"""To the \""thing\"", such knowledge was trivial, but the \""person\"" used it as a foundation for evolution."""
ra_020050_0050#0,"""This \""person\"" roused the curiosity of the \""thing\""."""
ra_020050_0055#0,"""Despite being omniscient, it could not understand the \""person's\"" heart. The \""thing\"" was vexed."""
ra_020050_0060#0,"""Thus, the \""thing\"" and the \""person\"" became partners."""
ra_020050_0065#0,"""Each providing what the other desired, they had a prosperous relationship which spanned a long, long time."""
ra_020050_0080#0,"""The \""person\"" was greedy and lazy. Yet for the sake of pleasure, it spared no effort. This involved wringing out knowledge from the \""thing\""."""
ra_020050_0090#0,"""This kind of behaviour was unique and fun to observe, but... It was taken too lightly."""
ra_020050_0110#0,"""When the \""thing\"" noticed that it was the cause of this sloth and would bring about an eventual downfall, it stopped answering the \""person's\"" summons."""
ra_020050_0120#0,"""In doing so, with the intention to observe how the \""person\"" would change..."""
ra_020050_0130#0,"""The foolish one was not the \""person\"". It is I, the one who knew but did not answer, who was foolish."""
ra_020050_0140#0,"""...Do not be concerned.<br>When we met, I was happy.<br>That is an unchangeable fact."""
ra_020050_0150#0,"""If not, I would not be able to stand here talking to you. I did not believe such a present was possible."""
ra_020050_0160#0,"""There are many people who say \""The future is uncertain, therefore it is exciting.\"" Now I, too, believe that it is so."""
al_020030_0010#0,"""Yes, that explains everything! Just as I thought, Wopal's current state is the result of human engineering! I mean, it was like that before Luther ever got involved."""
al_020030_0020#0,"""He just showed up and remodeled the place to fit his own needs, like the selfish guy he is. I already guessed it was something like that, but I'm still angry."""
al_020030_0030#0,"""And now poor Theodore is another victim of Luther's selfishness. Rewriting someone's race like that... Is there no limit to what he'll remodel?"""
al_020030_0040#0,"""It seemed like everything was going according to his selfish plan, but you were secretly working to stop him. You'd even got the key to saving Theodore."""
al_020030_0050#0,"""If the flow of events so far has been guided by Xion... I wonder what could be coming next?"""
al_020030_0060#0,"""No matter how much you set up in advance, the path to victory won't be easy. Some tough times are coming, aren't they?"""
al_020030_0070#0,"""...Ooh, it's really hard to stop myself from peeking ahead to see how it ends."""
al_020030_0080#0,"""OK, coming up next up is the events created by Xion's final Matter Board."""
text01#0,"""<br>Matter Board [To Welcome The Future] has been obtained.<br>"""
