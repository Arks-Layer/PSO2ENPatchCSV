st_020760_0020#0,"""Is that... Clarissa? It's not the sham I made. The real one... it still exists."""
st_020760_0030#0,"""The one that wields it...I see, I see. That's how it is."""
st_020760_0040#0,"""Xion, you have your own methods of operating, I see. It was all futile, but well done."""
st_020760_0050#0,"""L- let go of Xion!"""
st_020760_0060#0,"""Let go...? Fufufu, oi oi, what are you saying?"""
st_020760_0070#0,"""I won't let her go a second time. I have no intention of letting her go."""
st_020760_0080#0,"""You know, I finally understand her. Xion and I will become perfection together... from now, I will know everything!"""
st_020760_0090#0,"""You... what are you saying?"""
st_020760_0100#0,"""Don't you guys understand? The woman in front of your eyes, what she is."""

st_020760_0120#0,"""Yes, she is the Akashic Record!"""
st_020760_0130#0,"""The Photoners... no, my pursuit of the universe's logic!"""
st_020760_0140#0,"""How the Photoners were overwhelmed is a thing of the past. No... They went insane. Is that how I should put it?"""
st_020760_0150#0,"""That's why the Photoners that I saved gave up on their forms. They gave up their individuality."""
st_020760_0160#0,"""Fearing insanity, they threw themselves away. Worthless... truly worthless."""
st_020760_0170#0,"""What's inside her is just an aimless and drifting existence, what meaning is there? What value is there?"""
st_020760_0180#0,"""The ARKS, the Darkers, every single study and experiment, it was all to welcome this time, this moment!"""
st_020760_0190#0,"""Sacrificing the first Claris Claes' body, the undertaking of the improvement and mass production of the ARKS, it was all to buy time for this!"""
st_020760_0200#0,"""All of it was for this moment, to be with her, to become one with her... and finally, it came!"""
st_020760_0210#0,"""I will become one with her! To become an existence that understands all of creation in the universe!"""

st_020760_0270#0,"""Your surviving up until now has all been no more than a fancy of mine."""
st_020760_0280#0,"""The end of the war forty years ago... The Three Heroes you know, they proposed this to me."""
st_020760_0290#0,"""They would give me freedom, as long as I didn't target the other ARKS for experiments, you see."""
st_020760_0300#0,"""I didn't ask any questions, and cooperated. For tampering with, they were more optimal than the normal riffraff."""
st_020760_0310#0,"""Creating Void, I experimented and studied the Three Heroes every day, to improve the ARKS. Yeah, that was quite fun."""
st_020760_0320#0,"""Every now and then, I'd involve another ARKS. Well, I am sorry about that."""
st_020760_0330#0,"""The first Claris Claes... she became quite the magnificent guinea pig."""

st_020760_0350#0,"""To me, during the stalling, I did everything I could to understand Xion up until now. It was a great way to pass the time!"""

st_020760_0400#0,""".Calm down! Evacuate all hands to the other ships. Can the Campships move?"""
st_020760_0410#0,"""It's no use, the Mothership has seized all controls, we can't access them!"""

st_020760_0430#0,"""Re- recalculations complete! Life support systems will hit their limits in... 5 minutes!? What, what do we do?!"""
st_020760_0440#0,"""Don't panic! We need to do something, one way or another! If we give up... we all die."""
st_020760_0450#0,"""The ARKS that Regius and them sacrificed their bodies for to protect in such a sorry state. Fufu, hahahahaha!"""

st_020760_0470#0,"""...Why are you doing this? What do you think we are?!"""
st_020760_0480#0,"""What a thing to say. Weren't you ARKS originally the toys of the Photoners?"""
st_020760_0490#0,"""It's not just you guys. Everything in this vast universe is to me... A test site, my playground."""
st_020760_0500#0,"""And when you're done playing with your toys, you toss them aside. Isn't that obvious?"""
st_020760_0510#0,"""Now, Xion... Planet Xion, become one with me...!"""
st_020760_0520#0,"""...Wonderful. Amazing. This is magnificent!"""
st_020760_0530#0,"""Knowledge, it's rushing into my head. Ah, ah! It feels like it's going to burst! This torrent of information!"""
st_020760_0540#0,"""Fufu, too bad, Regius. Your existence in your chest can't love even once."""

st_020760_0630#0,"""What's this? Still feel like struggling? The ARKS' habits of endeavouring futilely is pretty troubling."""
st_020760_0640#0,"""In the end, the evil when you neared death infected even her... really, such a bother."""
st_020760_0650#0,"""...I don't understand. Xion's already gone, you know? What motivates you so?"""
st_020760_0660#0,"""1. I promised."""

st_020760_0720#0,"""X... Xion...! You, what are you...?!"""
