un_025170_0010#0,"""Umm, Xiao. Didn't you say earlier that Photoners were existences that could manipulate photons?"""
un_025170_0020#0,"""Then, why did the Photoners create the ARKS?"""
un_025170_0030#0,"""The Photoners could use photons, right? I don't think they needed to go out of their way to make the ARKS."""
un_025170_0040#0,"""...your way of getting straight to the point is scary."""
un_025170_0050#0,"""Oh, I got praised for once?"""
un_025170_0060#0,"""Your fearlessness is tiresome."""
un_025170_0070#0,"""Well, the answer is simple. The Photoners made the ARKS because they couldn't use photons anymore."""
un_025170_0080#0,"""They couldn't use photons anymore?"""
un_025170_0090#0,"""Yeah, not any more. The Photoners fought and somehow succeeded in sealing the [Profound Darkness]."""
un_025170_0100#0,"""However, the price was their power to use photons. They lost their countermeasure against the Darkers."""
un_025170_0110#0,"""So they made the ARKS. To take their place in the fight against the Darkers."""
un_025170_0120#0,"""Well, the ARKS got hijacked by Luther, but we somehow defeated him."""
un_025170_0130#0,"""And now, things are pretty hectic. Did you get all of that?"""
un_025170_0140#0,"""Hmm... if ARKS are artificially made beings, then am I something like a clone?"""
un_025170_0150#0,"""No, not quite. You guys have your own mothers and fathers."""
un_025170_0160#0,"""The only ARKS born from a test tube are the first of the first. ...of course, there are exceptions."""
un_025170_0170#0,"""Nnn, I don't get it... doesn't it seem a bit rushed on the part of the supervisors?"""
un_025170_0180#0,"""...You might just be more of a realist than I am. You think like a politician."""
un_025170_0190#0,"""...Back to the story. The Photoners and Luther were hoping for a sudden mutation, I think."""
un_025170_0200#0,"""A sudden mutation?"""
un_025170_0210#0,"""Yep. They were waiting for the birth of ARKS with great talent. Huey and Theodore are good examples."""
un_025170_0220#0,"""Although, the birth of Newmans completely unable to influence photons does occur."""
un_025170_0230#0,"""Ah, you looked my way for that. You're terrible."""
un_025170_0240#0,"""But, that there is what we call a mutation."""
un_025170_0250#0,"""Even in a perfectly controlled environment, deviation occurs. It's a mystery of nature."""
