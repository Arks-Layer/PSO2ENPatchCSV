ra_025020_0010#0,"""I was waiting for you, <%me>."""
ra_025020_0020#0,"""Hah! How was that? I sounded just like Xion, right?"""
ra_025020_0030#0,"""Well, I am an exact duplicate of her, so it's only natural that I sound just like her."""
ra_025020_0040#0,"""Anyway, forget about all that formal stuff. I'll be relying on you a lot in the future, so I'd prefer it if we were on a more casual footing."""
ra_025020_0050#0,"""Oh, right, the thing. The reason I called you here, the thing I could only tell you in person."""
ra_025020_0060#0,"""It's about that girl... Matoi."""
ra_025020_0070#0,"""To be honest, I have no clue who or what she is. There's no data about her anywhere."""
ra_025020_0080#0,"""She has that much power... and yet there aren't any records of her existence. It's very strange."""
ra_025020_0090#0,"""She's not in the ARKS database or in Xion's records. It's like she just doesn't exist. Almost as if she was intentionally kept hidden."""
ra_025020_0100#0,"""At first, I thought it must have been Luther who erased her, but...<br>Even he didn't know about her."""
ra_025020_0110#0,"""Which leaves only one person who'd be capable of this..."""
ra_025020_0120#0,"""That's right. Xion. Xion erased all data relating to Matoi."""
ra_025020_0130#0,"""And that's not all that's missing. All data from about ten years ago, absolutely everything, has been wiped out."""
ra_025020_0135#0,"""Not just the data on our systems, either. Even people's memories have been affected."""
ra_025020_0140#0,"""There's nothing to salvage, nothing to follow up on, nothing to investigate. A total blank."""
ra_025020_0150#0,"""Ten years ago... Something big must have happened back then, to have been wiped from everyone's memories. But we can't trace deleted records..."""
ra_025020_0160#0,"""In that case, our only option is to go there and investigate in person."""
ra_025020_0170#0,"""<%me>, you should be able to do that."""
ra_025020_0180#0,"""I'm not just saying all this out of curiosity, either."""
ra_025020_0190#0,"""Xion is gone, and Luther has been destroyed. From now on, ARKS is going to have to make some big changes."""
ra_025020_0200#0,"""In other words, I'll have to take on all the control Luther had, while also performing all the calculations Xion did."""
ra_025020_0210#0,"""If I'm going to be responsible for the new ARKS, I'll need to learn as much as I can."""
ra_025020_0220#0,"""No matter how bad it turns out to be."""
ra_025020_0230#0,"""That said, it's true that I'm curious. I want to know about everything that happened before I was born, and I want to learn more about myself."""
ra_025020_0240#0,"""So, I'll leave it up to you to decide what we do from now on. I think it's better if someone who doesn't know everything leads the way."""
ra_025020_0250#0,"""Still, if there's anything I can help you with, feel free to ask me any time. You can always find me here."""
ra_025030_0010#0,"""Thank you. I knew you'd agree."""
ra_025030_0020#0,"""Alright, now that that's taken care of, we need to get to work."""
ra_025030_0030#0,"""I've established the exact timestamp of the earliest deleted records. If you go back to that point in time, you might just learn something."""
ra_025030_0040#0,"""It should be fairly similar to the time travel you've experienced before."""
ra_025030_0050#0,"""I'm sure you'll be able to do this. After all, no one's more experienced at jumping back in time than you."""
ra_025030_0060#0,"""...It's possible that Xion anticipated all of this.<br>...Maybe that's why she chose you."""
ra_025030_0070#0,"""Head for the location. Leave the backup to me."""
ra_025030_0080#0,"""Let's find out what really happened back then."""
al_020040_0010#0,"""Xion's wish was to free ARKS from Luther's control, to give everyone back their future...<br>Something like that, anyway."""
al_020040_0020#0,"""To reach this solution, she had to try her calculations over and over again, failing every time...<br>This was the result she finally arrived at."""
al_020040_0030#0,"""...It's sad that Xion's gone, but this is the solution she gave us, so we just have to accept it."""
al_020040_0040#0,"""By following her plan, ARKS was able to break free of Luther's control.<br>...But there's still one more mystery left."""
al_020040_0050#0,"""To hide Second from Luther, every last piece of data about her on Oracle was erased, right down to people's memories."""
al_020040_0060#0,"""Something happened 10 years ago... Well, I suppose it'd be 13 years ago now, wouldn't it?"""
al_020040_0070#0,"""Only Xion had the kind of access to the Akashic Record that you'd need to do that. To erase someone from the memory of the world itself."""
al_020040_0080#0,"""Still, I think that's a pretty crazy thing to do. Xion was supposed to just be an observer, not go around doing things like that."""
al_020040_0090#0,"""Why did she want to hide Second until someone else could take her into their care? What was Xion thinking?"""
al_020040_0100#0,"""It seems that the answer lies in the past..."""
