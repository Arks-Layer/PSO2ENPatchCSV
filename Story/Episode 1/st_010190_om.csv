st_010190_0010#0,"""<%me>.<br>I must express my gratitude."""
st_010190_0020#0,"""Because of that chance encounter, a change has been observed and has lead to new possibilities."""
st_010190_0030#0,"""More than the possibilities, you seem more interested in the purpose. Am I correct?"""
st_010190_0040#0,"""You need not fully understand it."""
st_010190_0050#0,"""The only information I will divulge is that you have a chance to save many people."""
st_010190_om_0060#0,"""The only words that will convince you, I cannot learn..."""
st_010190_0070#0,"""I must apologize for not giving you enough information for you to trust me."""
st_010190_0080#0,"""For that, and for having to depend on you, I also apologize."""
st_010190_0090#0,"""A new Matter Board has formed. That is, new opportunities for chance encounters have become available."""
st_010190_0100#0,"""My regret continues, but I hope you will serve to remedy that."""
al_010020_0010#0,"""That's right, she was sending you to help the Second Generation after she collapsed on Naberius. That was Xion's plan."""
al_010020_0020#0,"""For that, I skipped forward to when you finished that mission... Hey, not too bad for my first try."""
al_010020_0030#0,"""The Matter Board, the realization of possibilities... The funny thing is, it has a similar feeling to my time stop."""
al_010020_0040#0,"""Magic, as Su would call it. No, maybe not quite on that level... Well, that aside."""
al_010020_0050#0,"""Even if you can travel back in time, changing history isn't easy. Time has a way of correcting things."""
al_010020_0060#0,"""For instance, if I were to change the fact that Luther killed me, I'd only end up dying some other way. That's how it usually works."""
al_010020_0070#0,"""But Xion can see the results of rewriting events. And from that, she can calculate how to get there."""
al_010020_0080#0,"""All that remains is to tell you what to rewrite. Hence the Matter Board. You can think of it as a set of instructions for creating the future."""
al_010020_0090#0,"""From here, you participate in altering events, leading to the future that Xion calculated."""
al_010020_0100#0,"""This would be impossible for either Xion or you alone. Only the two of you together could pull it off."""
al_010020_0110#0,"""Of course, even if you follow exactly what Xion says, it's not guaranteed that you can change anything."""
al_010020_0120#0,"""So you must have been unconsciously travelling back in time over and over, until you successfully changed what you needed to..."""
