st_010370_0020#0,"""What's wrong? For being made of metal, you sure aren't very tough! This is boring! Fight harder!"""
st_010370_0030#0,"""...This is awful."""
st_010370_0040#0,"""What do you think you're doing? This is my playground, and I'm not about to hand it over."""
st_010370_0050#0,"""Hmmm... never mind the Cast, but I've seen you before, haven't I?"""
st_010370_0060#0,"""It's <%me>, Master Gettemhart. You met on Naberius."""
st_010370_0070#0,"""Ah, right, right. That loser. This won't do! I should at least remember the names of my prey."""
st_010370_0080#0,"""But since you're here, then that masked bastard must be here, too, right?"""
st_010370_0090#0,"""...or do you think you can entertain me?"""
st_010370_0100#0,"""Get out of my sight, woman. I have no interest in you."""
st_010370_0110#0,"""So you're the ARKS member that caused all the destruction around here!"""
st_010370_0120#0,"""Destruction? What of it? That's what we do as ARKS, right?"""
st_010370_0130#0,"""We go down to planets and destroy all the enemies in our way. And that's just what I'm doing."""
st_010370_0140#0,"""That's not true. We also take care of the local inhabitants..."""
st_010370_0150#0,"""I don't want to listen to your useless drivel."""
st_010370_0160#0,"""Yeah, like we should care about natives that have surely been infected by Darkers. They'll only attack us."""
st_010370_0170#0,"""That's right, isn't it,<br><%me>?"""
st_010370_0190#0,"""1. Nod your head."""

st_010370_0270#0,"""What's with this little twerp? He just keeps staring this way."""
st_010370_0280#0,"""It doesn't matter. He's probably already infected by the Darkers. Watch, he'll come after us when we turn our backs."""
