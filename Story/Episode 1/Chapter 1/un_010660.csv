un_010660_0010#0,"""Hi, hi, hiiiii! ARKS's number one information dealer, Patty here!"""
un_010660_0020#0,"""We call ourselves information dealers, but to be honest, Patty just likes to gossip."""
un_010660_0030#0,"""Hey, that's not true! I choose our clients very carefully! And right now, you have an exclusive contract!"""
un_010660_0040#0,"""I don't think there's any way to get her to stop. Just humor her, she'll get bored and give it up sooner or later."""
un_010660_0050#0,"""Do you know about the Three Heroes?"""
un_010660_0060#0,"""They're to ARKS what ARKS are to normal people! The big cheeses of the whole shebang!"""
un_010660_0070#0,"""To fill in the gaps a bit here, the Three Heroes are the top three members of the Council of Six."""
un_010660_0080#0,"""Their names are Regius, Casra, and...<br>Uh... The last one is..."""
un_010660_0090#0,"""Claris Claes."""
un_010660_0100#0,"""Right, what you said!"""
un_010660_0110#0,"""The Three Heroes are so famous and important, their names get passed on to their successors when they retire!"""
un_010660_0120#0,"""But the original Regius is still going strong. The current Casra is only the second generation, and Claris Claes is the third. They really haven't been around all that long."""
un_010660_0130#0,"""So if you work hard, maybe you'll be famous enough to pass your own name on some day."""
un_010660_0140#0,"""There's something so cool about that whole inheriting names deal! When my name gets passed on-"""
un_010660_0150#0,"""Yeah, that's not happening."""
