un_012430_0020#0,"""Looking at ARKS as a whole, it seems that most members lack enthusiasm. Every time I meet people, that's what I'm checking for."""
un_012430_0030#0,"""With the revival of Dark Falz and that mysterious rampaging dragon, I can see why they'd feel that way!"""
un_012430_0040#0,"""But that's exactly why this isn't the time to cave in! That's what a third rate person does!"""
un_012430_0050#0,"""Everyone in ARKS is a professional, it's our duty to do everything first rate!"""
