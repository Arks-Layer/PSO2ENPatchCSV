un_012050_0020#0,"""I see. If I approach from outside your field of view, you don't notice me."""
un_012050_0030#0,"""I still don't know all of your abilities, but I'm a little closer to understanding."""
un_012050_0040#0,"""If I need to talk to you, I will call out to you."""
un_012050_0050#0,"""Please don't speak to me if you see me on my own. I might be working."""

un_012050_0070#0,"""Have you been able to locate the berserk dragon, Hadred?"""
un_012050_0080#0,"""Are you sure you haven't sensed anything?"""
un_012050_0090#0,"""With your keen senses, it would be trivial for you to track him down...!"""

un_012050_0120#0,"""Who is Hadred?"""
un_012050_0130#0,"""Because that dragon... Hadred... is a traitor."""
un_012050_0140#0,"""Hadred is the most powerful of the berserk dragons...<br>...And he is a deplorable traitor."""
un_012050_0150#0,"""Traitors cannot be forgiven. That is the cardinal rule of our organization. And so, by my hand..."""
un_012050_0160#0,"""...No, it's nothing. Forget what I said."""
