al_010090_0010#0,"""Over 40 years ago, Gi, Ri and I battled Dark Falz [Elder]."""
al_010090_0020#0,"""If all you consider is the result, it was a victory for ARKS. It nearly destroyed us... But it was a victory."""
al_010090_0030#0,"""[Elder]'s power was unthinkable. It altered the face of Naberius itself, freezing an area into the Tundra region."""

al_010090_0060#0,"""So, [Elder] was sealed away, with Clarissa as the key. But we told everyone that we'd \""defeated\"" him."""
