un_010670_0030#0,"""...It's starting to feel like we're turning into a comedy double-act."""
un_010670_0040#0,"""As long as we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, that's fine by me! Can't you just see my Photons sparkling?"""
un_010670_0050#0,"""Speaking of which, Photons are unusual, aren't they? You can't see them, but they're everywhere, and we can draw on them for power."""
