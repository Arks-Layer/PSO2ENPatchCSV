un_010720_0010#0,"""Hey, Patty here!"""
un_010720_0020#0,"""And Tia."""
un_010720_0030#0,"""Today we have some extremely vital information that you absolutely have to hear! You'll regret missing out!"""
un_010720_0040#0,"""It's information about our enemies, the Darkers!"""
un_010720_0050#0,"""Darkers have been called a lot of things: strong, scary, dangerous. But what exactly about them is all of those things?"""
un_010720_0060#0,"""We have some info that might make you rethink why they're so dangerous!"""
un_010720_0070#0,"""Alright, over to you, Professor Tia!"""
un_010720_0080#0,"""Eh? Why me? So... about Darkers?"""
un_010720_0090#0,"""The scariest thing about Darkers is not their strength, but their ability to infect."""
un_010720_0100#0,"""To put it simply, creatures who get infected by Darker Factor get sick, go crazy and eventually..."""
un_010720_0110#0,"""Become Darkers themselves. This is not a joke."""
un_010720_0120#0,"""The first sign of Darker influence is unusual violence, especially towards ARKS."""
un_010720_0130#0,"""Once a creature is infected, there's no sure way to cure it. And the infection only spreads further."""
un_010720_0140#0,"""That's why it's important to destroy anything that shows signs of infection."""
un_010720_0150#0,"""That's a lot more severe than I imagined."""
un_010720_0160#0,"""But don't worry, we ARKS have the power of Photons to protect us! No getting infected for us!"""
un_010720_0170#0,"""So far there have been no reports of infection in ARKS!<br>...As far as we know, anyway."""
un_010720_0180#0,"""Fighting the Darkers is like battling an endless, incurable disease."""
un_010720_0190#0,"""Which makes ARKS like some kind of long term doctor."""
un_010720_0200#0,"""Uuugh, after listening to what Tia was saying, I'm starting to feel sick. Maybe I'm infected?"""
un_010720_0210#0,"""I don't think even the Darkers would want someone as stupid as you."""
un_010720_0220#0,"""Ah thanks! That's a relief! Wait! What did you say about me?"""
