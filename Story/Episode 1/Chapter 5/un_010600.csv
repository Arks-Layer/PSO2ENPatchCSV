un_010600_0020#0,"""There's so many Darkers it's actually kind of annoying! Lisa wants to focus on enemies one-by-one, but there's just so many!"""
un_010600_0030#0,"""They've been increasing in number, Lisa thinks. They're lots of fun to kill, but it's annoying when there's too many of them at once."""
