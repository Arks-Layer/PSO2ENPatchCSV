st_013330_0010#0,"""Hmmm! There might actually be some strong bad guys from here on out."""
st_013330_0020#0,"""But still, if they run into Team Lisa and you, we'll just defeat them and<br>this'll be done in no time, won't it?"""
st_013330_0030#0,"""Speaking of which, yeah! Speaking of which, Lisa had a question to ask you, and she still does!"""
st_013330_0040#0,"""Oh, put your guard down. It's just a silly question."""
st_013330_0050#0,"""Why did you decide to get so strong?"""
st_013330_0060#0,"""For yourself? For someone else? Maybe for revenge? Or is it something else?"""
st_013330_0070#0,"""Well, honestly, it doesn't matter. That's hardly why Lisa is even asking."""
st_013330_0080#0,"""You see, Lisa is usually really good at reading people, but you're hard to read."""
st_013330_0090#0,"""Even after looking at you all this time, Lisa still doesn't understand your motivation."""
st_013330_0100#0,"""But Lisa is fine with not knowing. If Lisa doesn't know, she'll just keep staring at you until she does."""
st_013330_0110#0,"""Ah, Lisa doesn't want you to tell her. You'd become boring if you did."""
st_013330_0120#0,"""Lisa wants to keep enjoying this fuzzy feeling in her head."""
st_013330_0130#0,"""Anyways, in the time we took to have this chat, the other teams have probably caught up. Now it's exciting again."""
st_013330_0140#0,"""Team Lisa and <%me> will still win anyways, though. Hehe. Hehehe!"""
