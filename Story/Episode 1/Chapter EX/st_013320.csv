st_013320_0010#0,"""Hehe, very good. You've been getting better and better at fighting, you know?"""
st_013320_0020#0,"""Some of your moves are so sharp that it gives Lisa chills. You've made so much progress."""
st_013320_0030#0,"""Lisa doesn't have faulty eyes. She might have other parts that are faulty, but Lisa takes pride in her eyes."""
st_013320_0040#0,"""Lisa gets a very special feeling from you. It actually kind of scares Lisa."""
st_013320_0050#0,"""You can become way, waaay stronger. That's for sure. Lisa's eyes are never wrong."""
st_013320_0060#0,"""So get way, waaay stronger so you can kill more and more and more and more bad guys with Lisa, okay?"""
st_013320_0070#0,"""HAAAHAHA! Well done, contestants! I hope you all had fun?!"""
st_013320_0080#0,"""Hey, Huey! HEY, HUEY! I wanna join too! Why can't I join the tournament?!"""
st_013320_0090#0,"""Because you're a staff member... Ahem... This is an intermission progress report!"""
st_013320_0100#0,"""The team with the most points is currently Team Lisa and <%me>!"""
st_013320_0110#0,"""That name sounds familiar... Have I heard it before somewhere?"""
st_013320_0120#0,"""...Wait, what's with this score? Aren't they going a bit overboard? Well hey, if they're that strong, good for them!"""
st_013320_0122#0,"""In second place is Team Ohza the Hunter and Marlu the Force!"""
st_013320_0124#0,"""The Informant Sisters everyone's been talking about are also holding their own!"""
st_013320_0126#0,"""Who?"""
st_013320_0140#0,"""That being said, nobody's too far behind from anyone! It's a close match, and still anyone's game at this point, folks!"""
st_013320_0150#0,"""Hey, Huey. Are you really having fun just reading off of a prompter like this?"""
st_013320_0160#0,"""Contestants, we look forward to your performance in the second half! That's all for now!"""
st_013320_0170#0,"""...Listen, Claris Claes. Becoming an adult is a sad thing. Sometimes a script is necessary."""
st_013320_0175#0,"""For now, the least you could do is read up on the contestants."""
st_013320_0180#0,"""Oh dear, what's this? Maybe we went a little overboard for only the first half?"""
st_013320_0190#0,"""Doesn't really matter, though. Lisa's going even harder in the second half."""
