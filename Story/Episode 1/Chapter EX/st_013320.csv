st_013320_0010#0,"""Hehe, very good. You've been getting better and better at fighting, you know?"""
st_013320_0020#0,"""Some of your moves are so sharp that it gives Lisa chills. You've made so much progress."""
st_013320_0030#0,"""Lisa doesn't have faulty eyes. She might have other parts that are faulty, but Lisa takes pride in her eyes."""
st_013320_0040#0,"""Lisa gets a very special feeling from you. It actually kind of scares Lisa."""
st_013320_0050#0,"""You can become way, waaay stronger. That's for sure. Lisa's eyes are never wrong."""
st_013320_0060#0,"""So get way, waaay stronger so you can kill more and more and more and more bad guys with Lisa, okay?"""
st_013320_0070#0,"""Hahahaha! Hey there, participants! I hope you're enjoying yourselves!"""
st_013320_0080#0,"""Huey, Huey! I want to take part too! Let me join in!"""
st_013320_0090#0,"""You're part of the staff... Ahem... time to report the current standing!"""
st_013320_0100#0,"""...Right now, the pair in the lead is the Ranger Lisa and <%me>!"""
st_013320_0110#0,"""Oh, I feel like I've heard that name before..."""
st_013320_0120#0,"""...I mean, isn't this score a bit too high? But if they're that strong,<br>that's OK!"""
st_013320_0122#0,"""Next, the pair of the Force Marlu and the Hunter Ohza!"""
st_013320_0124#0,"""But it seems like the rumored Information Sisters are also working hard!"""
st_013320_0126#0,"""Who?"""
st_013320_0140#0,"""Nonetheless, it's neck-and-neck! The ARKS Battle Championship is a fierce struggle! The tide could turn at any moment!"""
st_013320_0150#0,"""Hey, Huey. Aren't you just reading from your notes? How's that fun?"""
st_013320_0160#0,"""The second half of the game begins here, so we expect you to do your best! That's all!"""
st_013320_0170#0,"""Look, Claris Claes. I know that acting like an adult can be difficult. But sometimes we need to follow the script."""
st_013320_0175#0,"""For now, let's read up about the participants."""
st_013320_0180#0,"""Oh dear, what's this? Maybe we went a little overboard for only the first half?"""
st_013320_0190#0,"""Doesn't really matter, though. Lisa's going even harder in the second half."""
