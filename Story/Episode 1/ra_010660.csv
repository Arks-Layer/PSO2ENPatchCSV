ra_010660_0020#0,"""No, the assassin hasn't come after me. Fourier is taking care of me, too."""
ra_010660_0030#0,"""But more importantly, there's something I've been curious about."""
ra_010660_0040#0,"""The reason I was targeted."""
ra_010660_0050#0,"""If there were something hidden in the tundra area, then access would be restricted."""
ra_010660_0060#0,"""However, ARKS are allowed free access to the entire area. So what red flag did I set off?"""
ra_010660_0070#0,"""The parameters I measured during the geological survey seems to be the mostly likely cause."""
ra_010660_0080#0,"""The samples from the tundra had traces of Darkers in them. And pretty deep."""
ra_010660_0090#0,"""Which would mean that Darkers have been on Naberius for quite a long time."""
ra_010660_0100#0,"""That alone might not be too surprising. But there was one more thing..."""
ra_010660_0110#0,"""That tundra itself might have been caused by Darkers."""
ra_010660_0120#0,"""I haven't been able to wrap my head around the whole picture yet."""
ra_010660_0130#0,"""However, I must have done something to touch on some secret of the ARKS."""
ra_010660_0140#0,"""A Darker is the cause of the tundra. A seemingly massive one, at that. There was something else..."""
ra_010660_0150#0,"""Sorry, I can't remember. I'll have to look into it some more."""
