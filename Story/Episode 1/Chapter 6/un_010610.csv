un_010610_0010#0,"""Hello! Are you alive? Yep, you're alive!"""
un_010610_0020#0,"""Can't say that for a lot of the planets' native creatures, though. They just keep dying, don't they?"""
un_010610_0030#0,"""Once they get infected by Darkers, they're pretty much already dead. Infected creatures get killed by ARKS, after all, right?"""
un_010610_0040#0,"""Lisa hasn't had a single conversation with any native creature, but she kind of wonders what they must be thinking, you know?"""
un_010610_0050#0,"""It must feel bizarre. And scary. And painful, Lisa thinks."""
un_010610_0060#0,"""Maybe that's why they attack ARKS along with anything else they see."""
un_010610_0070#0,"""You do know that not every native creature attacks us because it's been infected by Darkers, right?"""
un_010610_0080#0,"""From their perspective, we probably look no different from the Darkers. We're just another hostile invader to them."""
un_010610_0090#0,"""Oh well. Doesn't matter to Lisa either way. If she sees an enemy, she shoots it. Hehehe."""
