st_010090_0010#0,"""...help..."""
st_010090_0020#0,"""Glad to see you made it back. You didn't get hurt, did you?"""
st_010090_0030#0,"""Hey now, I was with them. You think I'd ever let something happen to some rookies?"""
st_010090_0040#0,"""That's what I was worried about. I know it was probably a lot to deal with, but it looks like you guys made it."""
st_010090_0050#0,"""...hey."""
st_010090_0060#0,"""Um, sir? Who is this?"""
st_010090_0070#0,"""Oh and uh... I don't think I caught your name either, sir..."""
st_010090_0080#0,"""Zeno, don't tell me you didn't even bother to introduce yourself."""
st_010090_0090#0,"""Now that you mention it, I completely forgot. I figured they already knew who I was."""
st_010090_0100#0,"""My name is Zeno. The obnoxious one here is Echo."""
st_010090_0110#0,"""Nice to meet you, and I'm not the obnoxious one."""
st_010090_0120#0,"""My name is Afin. I'm pleased to meet you."""
st_010090_0130#0,"""And this is my partner,<br><%me>."""
st_010090_0140#0,"""We just joined the ARKS and have no idea what to make of anything yet..."""
st_010090_0150#0,"""Don't worry about it. You can think about it later, or investigate on your own."""
st_010090_0160#0,"""Those things we were fighting are Darkers. They are the enemies of the ARKS. That's all there is to it."""
st_010090_0170#0,"""Rather than having it explained to you, it's better that you got to see it for yourself."""
st_010090_0180#0,"""Hey, Zeno! Don't you think that's a bit much? They've been<br>through a lot."""
st_010090_0190#0,"""Why would I bother to put it nicely now that they've already seen it for themselves?"""
st_010090_0200#0,"""Knowing that in advance and being prepared will let you live longer in this line of work."""
st_010090_0210#0,"""Hey, why so glum? You're still alive, right? Mission complete, good work."""
st_010090_0220#0,"""But... another examinee died right in front of our eyes..."""
st_010090_0230#0,"""That comes with the territory for the ARKS. We don't have time to mourn everyone."""
st_010090_0240#0,"""Hey... hold your head up. We have to persevere, for all those who fall in battle."""
st_010090_0250#0,"""...Okay."""
st_010090_0260#0,"""That's good, Afin. If you can come to terms with this, you're already well on your way."""
st_010090_0270#0,"""But hold onto these feelings,<br>and don't give up. As long as you keep going, things tend to work out."""
st_010090_0280#0,"""That's cool and all, but he's just showing off. Everything he told you, he learned from his teacher."""
st_010090_0290#0,"""Hey! Don't blow my cover, Echo!<br>I'm allowed to quote our<br>teacher's wisdom."""
st_010090_0300#0,"""I wish you'd stop going off on these tangents. Don't you ever think how annoying it is for me to have to listen to you?"""
st_010090_0310#0,"""Hey! I don't get on your case for being late all the time!"""
st_010090_0320#0,"""Don't bring that up! Whatever, looks like we're almost back to the ARKS ship anyway."""
st_010090_0330#0,"""Wipe those grins off your faces, rookies! Let's go."""
