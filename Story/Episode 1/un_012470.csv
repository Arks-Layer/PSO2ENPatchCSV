un_012470_0010#0,"""Oh hello <%me>."""
un_012470_0020#0,"""Excellent timing, there's something I wanted to ask you."""
un_012470_0030#0,"""The information is about what's happened to Zeno."""
un_012470_0040#0,"""After you retreated, we kept fighting Falz, but as the fight continued we got overwhelmed."""
un_012470_0050#0,"""That's when Zeno made the gamble for us to split up. He drew Dark Falz further away."""
un_012470_0060#0,"""From there I've been trying to track down what happened to him, but I haven't found any leads."""
un_012470_0070#0,"""I... see..."""
un_012470_0080#0,"""During the fight it was apparent that Dark Falz [Elder] was specifically targeting him, so he used that."""
un_012470_0090#0,"""As to Dark Falz's reasoning behind that, I am still unable to determine any."""
un_012470_0100#0,"""I know the reason. Falz's host was Gettemhart, which is why he may have stubbornly pursued him."""
un_012470_0110#0,"""Zeno probably knew this which is why he used himself as a decoy."""
un_012470_0120#0,"""I must apologize, even though I was with him, I wasn't able to do anything in the situation."""
un_012470_0130#0,"""That's understandable. Plus Zeno has always been like that."""
un_012470_0140#0,"""His body hasn't been found, so there's still a chance he might return, maybe."""
un_012470_0150#0,"""You're right. I'm hoping for the possibility as well."""
un_012470_0160#0,"""I still have a few others to contact today. If you'll excuse me here."""
un_012470_0170#0,"""What? Why are you looking at me like that?"""
un_012470_0180#0,"""It's okay, I'm alright. I'm used to having to wait a while for Zeno anyways."""
un_012470_0190#0,"""Plus in Zeno's absence I need to do my best. I hope we can work together."""
un_012470_0200#0,"""Alright! Let's do our best!"""
