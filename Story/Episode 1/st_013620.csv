st_013620_0010#0,"""This is the end of the forest area, looks like we get a small break."""
st_013620_0020#0,"""Watching you fight though, I think I could use a break."""
st_013620_0030#0,"""Every time I see you, you seem to get more refined. Honestly, I'm pretty jealous of your potential."""
st_013620_0040#0,"""The way you fight, it seems like you've mechanically done it over and over again."""
st_013620_0050#0,"""Still, for that short amount of time, I can't imagine how you've managed to grow this much."""
st_013620_0060#0,"""Sorry, I didn't mean anything by that, it seems that I got caught up in thought."""
st_013620_0070#0,"""It's definitely not a bad thing that you've gotten this strong, just don't get over confident."""
st_013620_0080#0,"""Hahaahha! Hello participants, are you having fun!?"""
st_013620_0090#0,"""Hmm, I want to participate too..."""
st_013620_0100#0,"""Hm... is someone calling me out?"""
st_013620_0110#0,"""I thought I told her to turn her communicator off. It's seems that everyone is half way, I need to read the report."""
st_013620_0120#0,"""Right now, the two out in front are the pair of <%me> and the Hunter Sara!"""
st_013620_0130#0,"""What? Wow! No way, an example of my strength. They called our names out directly!"""
st_013620_0140#0,"""It seems that Ohza the Hunter and the Force Marlu are trying their best as well!"""
st_013620_0150#0,"""Okay, I got it! On my way!"""
st_013620_0160#0,"""But still, everyone is in a dead heat. It could go any way in the second half!"""
st_013620_0170#0,"""It seems like I found something more interesting. Clarissa, let's get going!"""
st_013620_0180#0,"""Anyways, the second half is beginning now... oh wait, what?"""
st_013620_0190#0,"""Claris Claes, you're supposed to be putting on this event, don't disappear on me!"""
st_013620_0200#0,"""Well, it must be too fun to resist. Enjoy the second half, and everyone do your best!"""
st_013620_0210#0,"""It seems that old hag isn't in this. That means that I don't have to worry about the second half."""
st_013620_0220#0,"""What? Oh, nothing I was just talking to myself."""
st_013620_0230#0,"""It seems that we're in the lead as it is, let's keep it that way."""
