st_013620_0010#0,"""This is the end of the forest area, huh. Looks like we can take a break here."""
st_013620_0020#0,"""Watching you fight though, I don't think you need one."""
st_013620_0030#0,"""Every time I see you, you seem to get more refined. Honestly, I'm pretty jealous of how fast you've grown."""
st_013620_0040#0,"""Movement like that... I heard it's the result of relentless training that's been repeated over and over again."""
st_013620_0050#0,"""I don't know how much you can do that in such a short time..."""
st_013620_0060#0,"""Oh, sorry. It looked like I was blaming you or something."""
st_013620_0070#0,"""It's not bad to be strong. As long as you don't go over your limit, it's definitely a good thing."""
st_013620_0080#0,"""Hahahaha! Hey there, participants! I hope you're enjoying yourselves!"""
st_013620_0090#0,"""Ugh, I want to take part too..."""
st_013620_0100#0,"""Hm... is someone calling?"""
st_013620_0110#0,"""Please disconnect the communication line! Ahem... time to report the current standing!"""
st_013620_0120#0,"""...Right now, the pair in the lead is the pair of <%me> and the Hunter Sara!"""
st_013620_0130#0,"""What? Wow! No way, something that needs my power?! Maria even asked for me personally!"""
st_013620_0140#0,"""It seems that Ohza the Hunter and the Force Marlu are trying their best as well!"""
st_013620_0150#0,"""Okay, I got it! On my way!"""
st_013620_0160#0,"""Nonetheless, it's neck-and-neck! The Battle Tournament is a fierce struggle! The tide could turn at any moment!"""
st_013620_0170#0,"""I found something more fun, Clarissa! Sortie, quickly!"""
st_013620_0180#0,"""The second half of the game begins here, so... Aw, come on!"""
st_013620_0190#0,"""Claris Claes, you're supposed to be putting on this event, don't disappear on me!"""
st_013620_0200#0,"""Well, it did look like fun! The second half of the game begins here, so we expect you to do your best! That's all!"""
st_013620_0210#0,"""...Seems like that old hag has left. I can stick around, then..."""
st_013620_0220#0,"""Huh? Oh, sorry. Forget you heard that."""
st_013620_0230#0,"""Anyway, it looks like we can keep our lead by carrying on as we are."""
