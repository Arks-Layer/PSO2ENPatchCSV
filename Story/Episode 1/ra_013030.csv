ra_013030_0010#0,"""Hm? About the past? You want to hear about when Dark Falz first appeared?"""
ra_013030_0020#0,"""I can tell you a little of what I learned about it..."""
ra_013030_0030#0,"""...Ah, damn it. I was never very good at studying."""
ra_013030_0040#0,"""I don't know if I remember everything, if that's OK."""
ra_013030_0050#0,"""As far as I can recall, Dark Falz's name popped up twice."""
ra_013030_0060#0,"""There was a war 40 years ago, and the incident 10 years ago."""
ra_013030_0070#0,"""40 years ago. That's when they said Dark Falz [Elder] was defeated."""
ra_013030_0080#0,"""Well, I guess it turned out to be sealed, rather than defeated."""
ra_013030_0090#0,"""The main three members at that time became the Three Heroes."""
ra_013030_0100#0,"""The Three Heroes became the center of ARKS, rebuilding after the war left them devastated, that's how it went."""
ra_013030_0110#0,"""Then 10 years ago. I remember that myself..."""
ra_013030_0120#0,"""Dark Falz went on a large-scale offensive against ARKS."""
ra_013030_0130#0,"""Uh... I think Dark Falz was repelled by the power of the second generation Claris Claes."""
ra_013030_0140#0,"""But she died where we stood, so the current Claris Claes is the third generation."""
ra_013030_0150#0,"""Yeah, a lot of famous people died back then, it was such a tragedy."""
ra_013030_0160#0,"""I wonder how many ships were destroyed in that battle..."""
ra_013030_0170#0,"""Civilians were hurt too, not just ARKS."""
ra_013030_0180#0,"""And my older sister disappeared..."""
ra_013030_0190#0,"""Oh, sorry! I went off on a bit of a tangent!"""
ra_013030_0200#0,"""Well, that's it. Sorry, there's a lot I don't remember."""
ra_013030_0210#0,"""Looking back at it, we did a lot better this time."""
ra_013030_0220#0,"""...It hurts that we lost people we knew."""
ra_013030_0230#0,"""...Ah, hold on. Zeno hasn't been confirmed dead yet."""
ra_013030_0240#0,"""Yeah, that's right. He's just missing. It's alright, it'll be alright!"""
