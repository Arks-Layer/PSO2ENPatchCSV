un_010620_0020#0,"""Well, it doesn't matter to Lisa either way. She's just making conversation."""
un_010620_0030#0,"""But but but! It's not good to avoid your problems, you know! You shouldn't just pretend you're fine either."""
un_010620_0040#0,"""Whatever happens, no matter what it is, it's your life and yours alone, so you might as well have fun, you know?"""

un_010620_0090#0,"""That being said, everyone goes through hard times, so maybe Lisa gave you some food for thought."""
un_010620_0100#0,"""Anyways, bye now! Bye bye. Bye bye bye!"""
