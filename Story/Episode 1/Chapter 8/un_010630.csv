un_010630_0020#0,"""Lately, something's been on Lisa's mind. You'll listen to Lisa's idle musings, yes?"""
un_010630_0030#0,"""Why do you think it is that Darkers attack ARKS?"""
un_010630_0040#0,"""When one becomes infected, they go berserk, and are especially hostile towards ARKS in particular... But why?"""
un_010630_0050#0,"""Darker infection causes insanity, right? So how can they still tell who's ARKS and who's not?"""
un_010630_0060#0,"""How curious! How mysterious! Maybe they do have some reasoning, but that sort of information hasn't been made public."""
un_010630_0070#0,"""Maybe the only way to truly understand their reasoning is to try becoming a Darker yourself?"""
