un_010630_0010#0,"""Hello. Have you been killing a lot of Darkers? Or maybe a lot of infected native creatures?"""
un_010630_0020#0,"""There's something that's been on Lisa's mind, would you mind listening for a second?"""
un_010630_0030#0,"""I wonder why Darkers attack ARKS?"""
un_010630_0040#0,"""Once infected a creature's violent tendencies increase, but especially towards ARKS, why?"""
un_010630_0050#0,"""But how are ARKS supposed to tell the difference between infected and non-infected."""
un_010630_0060#0,"""I don't understand it, and beyond that ARKS doesn't give us any information on how to do so."""
un_010630_0070#0,"""I suppose that after you experience it once then it becomes obvious?"""
un_010630_0080#0,"""Fufu, I was just joking. I just enjoy killing, the reason doesn't really matter to me."""
