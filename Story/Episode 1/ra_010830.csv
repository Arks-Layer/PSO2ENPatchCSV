ra_010830_0020#0,"""I've been on the Amdusican Skyscape for too long. I came back to take a break."""
ra_010830_0030#0,"""I was starting to think that you were going to live there!"""
ra_010830_0040#0,"""Shut up, Light. A guy who obsesses over details like that, you're worthless."""
ra_010830_0050#0,"""Hmm? You brought something interesting? Would you mind showing it to me?"""
ra_010830_0060#0,"""Hmm? Something that missing research student left behind in the tundra?"""
ra_010830_0070#0,"""Let me see..."""
ra_010830_0080#0,"""So, <%me>."""
ra_010830_0090#0,"""That research student was supposedly killed by Darkers or native creatures."""
ra_010830_0100#0,"""But something is off here... really off. Light, can you tell what that is?"""
ra_010830_0110#0,"""Something strange about it? Oh, this parameter is off."""
ra_010830_0120#0,"""Darker residue? Or from native creatures? Wait, it's neither!"""
ra_010830_0130#0,"""Nice observation. That was my conclusion as well. This was caused by the photon weapons the ARKS use."""
ra_010830_0140#0,"""I don't know the circumstances, but this is no simple missing persons case."""
ra_010830_0150#0,"""If I weren't in the middle of investigating the Dragonkin, I would delve deeper into this."""
ra_010830_0160#0,"""<%me>, you should be careful."""
