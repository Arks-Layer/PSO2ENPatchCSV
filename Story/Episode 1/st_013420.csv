st_013420_0010#0,"""Phew, was that the first stage? This looks like a break point."""
st_013420_0020#0,"""Still, after fighitng all those Darkers, it's crazy that they'd hold a Battle Championship on this planet."""
st_013420_0030#0,"""Well... ここに対する恐怖感というか不安感の払拭を兼ねているのかもしれないけどさ."""
st_013420_0040#0,"""おれがずいぶん前に相棒へ頼んだ依頼のような感じで."""
st_013420_0050#0,"""But... what is it? It doesn't feel like danger, but I'm still uneasy..."""
st_013420_0060#0,"""いや、不安だけでもないのか. 何だろうなこれ、懐かしいような怖いような...あー、よくわからん!"""
st_013420_0070#0,"""Hahahaha! Hey there, participants! I hope you're enjoying yourselves!"""
st_013420_0080#0,"""Huey, Huey! I want to take part too! Let me join in!"""
st_013420_0090#0,"""You're part of the staff... Ahem... time to report the current standing!"""
st_013420_0100#0,"""...Right now, the pair in the lead is the Ranger Afin and <%me>!"""

st_013420_0124#0,"""But it seems like the rumored Information Sisters are also working hard!"""
st_013420_0126#0,"""Who?"""
st_013420_0140#0,"""Nonetheless, it's neck-and-neck! The ARKS Battle Championship is a fierce struggle! The tide could turn at any moment!"""
st_013420_0150#0,"""Hey, Huey. Aren't you just reading from your notes? How's that fun?"""

st_013420_0170#0,"""Look, Claris Claes. I know that becoming an adult can be a sad thing. But sometimes we need to follow the script."""
st_013420_0175#0,"""For now, let's read up about the participants."""
st_013420_0180#0,"""Well... I'm glad that we're in the lead... I can't focus with this feeling."""
st_013420_0190#0,"""I wonder what this is. Partner, do you feel it too? Is it just me? Well..."""
