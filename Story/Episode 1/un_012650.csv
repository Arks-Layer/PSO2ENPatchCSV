un_012650_0010#0,"""Yahoo! Sorry to make you all wait! Patty here!"""
un_012650_0020#0,"""I don't think that's the meaning of the word wait, when you're the one starting the conversation. And Tea here."""
un_012650_0030#0,"""So it seems Dark Falz has revived! Elder, was it?"""
un_012650_0040#0,"""Since then, everyone has been in a panic. No one will listen to my obnoxious voice!"""
un_012650_0050#0,"""It almost seems like you're somewhat irritated, but I guess that can't be helped."""
un_012650_0060#0,"""It seems that upon hearing their superiors were hiding information, everyone in ARKS has been on edge."""
un_012650_0070#0,"""That's why I need to put everyone at ease with my cheerful demeanor!"""
un_012650_0080#0,"""...The same as ever."""
un_012650_0090#0,"""Well, they may have been hiding Falz's revival, but so what?"""
un_012650_0100#0,"""I actually agree with Patty here. The important part is making sure it doesn't happen again."""
un_012650_0110#0,"""Especially the information part. That makes our job as information dealers all the more important!"""
un_012650_0120#0,"""Even if there is a cover up, it's our job to make it known as soon as possible."""
un_012650_0130#0,"""That seems dangerous, but as information dealers, we should be prepared for that much."""
un_012650_0140#0,"""So, wait with anticipation for Patty's next bit of info!"""
