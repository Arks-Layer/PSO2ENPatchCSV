un_010730_0010#0,"""It's been a few years since I started ARKS and it feels like I never stop fighting. Oh hello, Patty here."""
un_010730_0020#0,"""What's gotten into you Patty? Are you feeling sick? And this is Tea."""
un_010730_0030#0,"""Because we have to go all over the place fighting and I never get to do what I want to do!"""
un_010730_0040#0,"""I'm still a little girl, I should be out playing somewhere!"""
un_010730_0050#0,"""You think so too right? Want to go play?"""
un_010730_0060#0,"""Then why don't you just quit ARKS?"""
un_010730_0070#0,"""Then I wouldn't be able to go to different planets and I would be extremely bored!"""
un_010730_0080#0,"""I'm not suited for that kind of lifestyle at all!"""
un_010730_0090#0,"""Hm, you seem different from normal Patty. Did something bad happen?"""
un_010730_0100#0,"""Isn't everyone's goal in ARKS just to fight? That seems weird!"""
un_010730_0110#0,"""We're fighting for peace. Fighting is just the means and yet that seems to be the goal for most people!"""

un_010730_0140#0,"""Tea, what do you mean \""for once\""?"""
un_010730_0150#0,"""Let's go play! I want to relax so I can remember what relaxing is once all of the fighting is over!"""
un_010730_0160#0,"""...is that really your reason?"""
