un_010460_0020#0,"""Recently it feels like native creatures are all I ever fight."""
un_010460_0030#0,"""The native creatures that attack us on sight are infected by Darkers."""
un_010460_0040#0,"""Even though I know that, there are so many that look normal that I get caught off-guard quite often."""
un_010460_0050#0,"""But Darkers are really irritating aren't they? Using innocent creatures for weapons. I can't accept that!"""
un_010460_0060#0,"""That's why until we can stop killing native creatures, I won't rest until we defeat all of the Darkers!"""
un_010460_0070#0,"""Sorry for going off on a rant..."""
un_010460_0080#0,"""Anyways, I'm off. Good luck to the both of us."""
