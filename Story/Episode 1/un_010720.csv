un_010720_0010#0,"""Hey it's Patty!"""
un_010720_0020#0,"""And Tea."""
un_010720_0030#0,"""Today we have some very vital information that you have to hear!"""
un_010720_0040#0,"""That's information on our enemies, the Darkers!"""
un_010720_0050#0,"""Darkers have been called a lot of things, strong, scary, dangerous. But what exactly about them is all of those things?"""
un_010720_0060#0,"""We have some info that might make you rethink why they're so dangerous!"""
un_010720_0070#0,"""Alright Tea, the rest it up to you!"""
un_010720_0080#0,"""Eh? Why me? So... about Darkers?"""
un_010720_0090#0,"""The scariest thing about Darkers is not their strength, but their ability to infect."""
un_010720_0100#0,"""To put it simply, creatures who get infected by Darker particles, get sick, go crazy and finally..."""
un_010720_0110#0,"""Become Darkers themselves. This is not a joke."""
un_010720_0120#0,"""After being influenced by Darkers, the first sign is unusual violence, especially towards ARKS."""
un_010720_0130#0,"""That and once you get infected, there's no sure way to cure it. And it only spreads further."""
un_010720_0140#0,"""That's why it's important to destroy anything that shows signs of symptoms."""
un_010720_0150#0,"""That's a lot more severe than I imagined."""
un_010720_0160#0,"""But don't worry, since ARKS use photons in our bodies; we have a natural protection from getting infected!"""
un_010720_0170#0,"""As of now there are no reports of that happening! ...probably."""
un_010720_0180#0,"""So fighting with Darkers is like fighting a limitless disease."""
un_010720_0190#0,"""So ARKS is like some kind of long term doctor."""
un_010720_0200#0,"""Uuugh, after listening to what you said Tea, I think I started to feel sick. Maybe I'm infected?"""
un_010720_0210#0,"""I don't think even the Darkers would want someone as stupid as you."""
un_010720_0220#0,"""Ah thanks! That's a relief! Wait! What did you say about me?"""
