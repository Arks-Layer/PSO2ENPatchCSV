un_012310_0020#0,"""Hello, Tea here."""
un_012310_0030#0,"""The Information Bureau that doesn't fear the reach of the Death Squad. We have some fresh new info for you!"""
un_012310_0040#0,"""It turns out that the Research Facility had two functions; research on giving photon attributes to living organisms, and on Darkers."""
un_012310_0050#0,"""The photon research aside, the Darker research is very suspicious!"""
un_012310_0060#0,"""The accident occurred in the middle of an experiment, which begs the question, just what were they experimenting on?"""
un_012310_0070#0,"""Unfortunately that's where the trail dries up! And I really want to know exactly what happened!"""
un_012310_0080#0,"""We thought this would take longer to uncover, but when we inquired about it we came across this information right away."""

un_012310_0120#0,"""You'd still need to clean up any loose ends, and lying would likely lead to more questions."""
un_012310_0130#0,"""The answer is simple, allow the cause to leak to and stand by with a reasonable explanation, but nothing beyond that."""
un_012310_0140#0,"""I don't know how to respond, Patty did you just say something intelligent?"""
un_012310_0150#0,"""This is the first information retrieval request we've been entrusted with. It's only natural for me to give it my all!"""
un_012310_0160#0,"""Unfortunately this is the extent of the information available to us."""
un_012310_0170#0,"""Anything beyond this is up to you to find out."""
