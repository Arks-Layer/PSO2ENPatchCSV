st_013320_0010#0,"""Heheh, this is fun. The way you fight is getting more and more sophisticated."""
st_013320_0020#0,"""Sometimes when I see you dart around in the corner of my eyes I get shivers, you've really grown."""
st_013320_0030#0,"""Lisa's eyes aren't confused. Other parts maybe, but Lisa is confident in her eyes."""
st_013320_0040#0,"""You in particular gave off a special feeling. It made Lisa feel small."""
st_013320_0050#0,"""You can become the strongest of all. Lisa's eyes don't make mistakes, it's already certain."""
st_013320_0060#0,"""Don't you want to become the strongest and kill enemies slowly and kill them and kill them and kill them?"""
st_013320_0070#0,"""Hahahaha! Hey there, participants! I hope you're enjoying yourselves!"""
st_013320_0080#0,"""Huey, Huey! I want to take part too! Let me join in!"""
st_013320_0090#0,"""You're part of the staff... Ahem... time to report the current standing!"""
st_013320_0100#0,"""...Right now, the pair in the lead is the Ranger Lisa and <%me>!"""
st_013320_0110#0,"""Oh, I think I've heard that name before..."""
st_013320_0120#0,"""...I mean, isn't this score a bit too high? But if they're that strong, that's OK!"""
st_013320_0122#0,"""Next, the pair of the Force Marlu and the Hunter Ohza!"""
st_013320_0124#0,"""But it seems like the rumored Information Sisters are also working hard!"""
st_013320_0126#0,"""Who?"""
st_013320_0140#0,"""Nonetheless, it's neck-and-neck! The Battle Tournament is a fierce struggle! The tide could turn at any moment!"""
st_013320_0150#0,"""Hey, Huey. Aren't you just reading from your notes? How's that fun?"""
st_013320_0160#0,"""The second half of the game begins here, so we expect you to do your best! That's all!"""
st_013320_0170#0,"""Look, Claris Claes. I know that becoming an adult can be a sad thing. But sometimes we need to follow the script."""
st_013320_0175#0,"""For now, let's read up about the participants."""
st_013320_0180#0,"""Are you alright? Did you push yourself too hard in the first half?"""
