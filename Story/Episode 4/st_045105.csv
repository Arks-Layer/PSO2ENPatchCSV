st_045100_0070#0,"""I'm so glad, big sis... You woke up and I'm so... glad......"""
st_045100_0080#0,"""Hmm, this will take some getting used to. No matter, I'm sure I'll fully control it soon."""
st_045100_0090#0,"""...Where is Aru?"""
st_045100_0100#0,"""You saw it for yourself, Hitsugi. I've absorbed that catalyst."""
st_045100_0110#0,"""I'm glad you woke up. Combined with your escape from the moon, your access here through PSO2 shows great promise. However... you were just a bit too late."""
st_045100_0120#0,"""Aru is... in Mother... You mean he's inside of you?"""
st_045100_0130#0,"""Yes...? What about it?"""
st_045100_0140#0,"""I see..."""
st_045100_0150#0,"""What odd and unpleasant laughter, Hitsugi Yasaka. I can't understand why you're smiling."""
st_045100_0160#0,"""There's a lot to being a girl. Cowardice, frustration, anger... With all of those mixed together, all I can do now is laugh."""
st_045100_0170#0,"""You should go back to sleep once more. The next time you wake up, everything should be finished."""
st_045100_0180#0,"""But, you know... I finally understand. I understand what I need to do."""
st_045100_0190#0,"""What...?"""
st_045100_0200#0,"""I was such an idiot. Careless, reckless, acting without thinking. Pitiful, crying about everything."""
st_045100_0210#0,"""But, I've experienced all those already. I won't act like that again. I'll never forget those feelings."""
st_045100_0220#0,"""I hate being scared, and I hate being in pain. But above all else, I hate being alone!"""
st_045100_0230#0,"""I don't want to lose anyone anymore! I don't want to let anyone disappear! I'll protect the things that matter to me!"""
st_045100_0240#0,"""That's it, right... it's only natural! The place where I belong is... the place where I stand right now!"""

st_045100_0400#0,"""I find it offensive that you think I'm just some flustered child."""
st_045100_0410#0,"""However... taking back the controls is my limit. Controlling all the data across the ship is... Further assistance is not... possible."""
