st_048020_0010#0,"""After Ardem withdrew, we lost contact with the Earth Guide headquarters in Las Vegas..."""
st_048020_0020#0,"""As for the other branches, they contacted ARKS with inquiries into what had happened."""
st_048020_0030#0,"""We can reasonably assume that the rest of Earth Guide did not know of Ardem's true intentions."""
st_048020_0040#0,"""Ardem's real intentions... Taking the power of a weakened Mother and..."""
st_048020_0050#0,"""He was talking about guiding our evolution, right? How does he plan to do such a thing?"""
st_048020_0060#0,"""All of Earth guide, ARKS, everyone... we were all being used as tools for that moment... Ardem..."""
st_048020_0070#0,"""To him, there's no conflict of consciousness in doing so. He believes what he is doing is always \""right\"", after all."""
st_048020_0080#0,"""In fact, from his point of view, I'm sure he's not able to understand your reasoning. That's why he was trying to convince you."""
st_048020_0090#0,"""\""Mother is an evil demon who tried to manipulate the Earth. Why am I being criticized for killing it?\"""""
st_048020_0100#0,"""\""I'll take Mother's power and use it for the Earth. Isn't this the best outcome for Earth, an act of absolute justice?\"""""
st_048020_0110#0,"""\""Use it for the Earth\""... Does that mean he's going to do this evolution stuff using Mother's power?"""
st_048020_0120#0,"""Indeed. Ardem's goal is the evolution of the Earth. To return this world to the paradise it once was."""
st_048020_0130#0,"""Essentially, he means to use the power of Ether to recreate the world."""
st_048020_0140#0,"""I'm sure the absence of God in modern times, and the loss of that paradise, are unforgivable to that man. After being banished from that paradise, he's very determined."""
st_048020_0150#0,"""Demon Phaleg... How do you know so much? What's your relationship to Ardem?"""
st_048020_0160#0,"""...He and I are adversaries from the first and longest conflict in human history."""
st_048020_0170#0,"""I wanted to kill him before it got to this point, but there were so many unexpected variables..."""
st_048020_0180#0,"""Kill him... You're planning to kill Ardem?"""
st_048020_0190#0,"""Indeed, you are correct, young lady. That's the only option."""
st_048020_0200#0,"""Unlike Mother, he doesn't believe his actions are ever wrong. He'll never stop."""
st_048020_0210#0,"""Do you understand, young lady? That you will actually have to kill him."""
st_048020_0220#0,"""You hesitated even against an enemy like me. Can you really kill a former friend like him?"""
