st_045010_0010#0,"""No luck... I'm unable to track Hitsugi's reading."""
st_045010_0020#0,"""I see. Thanks for trying though, Xiera."""
st_045010_0030#0,"""1. Enga... I'm sorry."""
st_045010_0040#0,"""2. I'm sure Hitsugi is okay."""
st_045010_0050#0,"""It's not your fault, <%me>. It's the fault of my idiot sister who rushed in. It sounds terrible, but she got what was coming to her..."""
st_045010_0060#0,"""My idiot of a sister. Rushing in and not thinking clearly like that...!"""
st_045010_0070#0,"""I'm sorry. Big sis was taken instead of me..."""
st_045010_0080#0,"""You didn't do anything wrong, Aru. If you hadn't been there, she would have died. I can't thank you enough."""
st_045010_0090#0,"""Indeed... For a time, all of Hitsugi's biometrics showed her as dead."""
st_045010_0100#0,"""While I did confirm her vitals returning to normal after being healed by Aru... I wasn't able to get any other signals afterwards."""
st_045010_0110#0,"""Big sis, are you okay...?"""
st_045010_0120#0,"""Their target is Aru. They wouldn't throw away a pawn like Hitsugi so easily... They'll probably use her as bait to lure Aru in."""
st_045010_0130#0,"""For example, a hostage exchange."""
st_045010_0140#0,"""If it saves big sis, I'll do anything."""
st_045010_0150#0,"""Don't be stupid. You're Hitsugi's savior, and my younger brother. I'm not just going to hand you over."""
st_045010_0160#0,"""In any case, our decision will be based off of what Mother Cluster does."""
st_045010_0170#0,"""Ugh, this is irritating... I want to get Hitsugi back as soon as possible, but..."""
st_045010_0180#0,"""Of course, I'm not going to just sit around and do nothing. Don't you agree, Ardem?"""
st_045010_0190#0,"""...We do know the location of Mother Cluster's base."""
st_045010_0200#0,"""It's existed since ancient times... It was said to drive people insane, and was avoided for that reason. But it still exists, close to us."""
st_045010_0210#0,"""Their base is on... the moon."""
st_045010_0220#0,"""It was impossible to go there with our own technology... but with ARKS backing us, it's a different story."""
st_045010_0230#0,"""I'm sure Hitsugi is there, but... this is the enemy's base of operations."""
st_045010_0240#0,"""This is going to sound harsh, but... Enga, you're going to die if you go there."""
st_045010_0250#0,"""I know. I have no intention of dragging anyone else down with me. I will rescue her by myself."""
st_045010_0260#0,"""The logical thing to do would be to abandon my stupid little sister. It's absurd to even think of handing over Aru."""
st_045010_0270#0,"""That's why I'm going to rescue her myself. I'm going to go right into their base and take Hitsugi back."""
st_045010_0280#0,"""Big bro..."""
st_045010_0290#0,"""Don't look so worried, Aru. Everything will be okay. I'll rescue Hitsugi, no matter what."""
st_045010_0300#0,"""What, <%me>? Is my lecture on selfish actions running too long?"""
st_045010_0310#0,"""1. There's two people going on this rescue mission."""
st_045010_0320#0,"""2. You need ARKS strength, right?"""
st_045010_0330#0,"""<%me>... I appreciate your offer, but this is my selfish choice. I can't involve you as well."""
st_045010_0340#0,"""...What do you mean?"""
st_045010_0350#0,"""Then let's say that the condition for ARKS cooperating with Earth Guide is that <%me> accompanies you."""
st_045010_0360#0,"""Really, the older brother is just like the younger sister."""
st_045010_0370#0,"""After all we've been through, don't leave us behind now. We're all worried about Hitsugi too."""
st_045010_0380#0,"""My stupid little sister... I'm starting to get jealous at how much people like her."""
st_045010_0390#0,"""<%me>... If you're really going to tag along, I'll rely on your full support."""
st_045010_0400#0,"""Me too! I want to save big sis too!"""
st_045010_0410#0,"""If we're going to head right into the enemy's base, I can't promise your safety."""
st_045010_0420#0,"""I'll bring her back, just you wait."""
st_045010_0430#0,"""Don't even think about trying to stop me, Ardem."""
st_045010_0440#0,"""...There's nothing I can say to change your mind?"""
st_045010_0450#0,"""Not a chance. Not even if you threatened to fire me."""
st_045010_0460#0,"""...As Earth Guide, which has protected people since ancient times, I believe you're doing the right thing."""
st_045010_0470#0,"""I'll send over the coordinates for Mother Cluster's base. <%me>, Xiera, please take care of Enga."""
st_045010_0480#0,"""Wait for me, Hitsugi."""
