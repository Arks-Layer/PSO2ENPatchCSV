st_042120_0010#0,"""5 years ago... I lost both of my parents in an accident. When I was on the brink of despair, a kind, gentle voice reached me... That's how I met Mother."""
st_042120_0020#0,"""It wasn't face to face, just Mother's voice over the Ether. It was gentle, warm, and above all, it was always right."""
st_042120_0030#0,"""That's why I joined Mother Cluster. Believing in Mother's words, acting for her. It's an organization dedicated to Mother."""
st_042120_0040#0,"""But."""
st_042120_0050#0,"""Okay Aru, you can open your eyes now."""
st_042120_0060#0,"""Uwaah..! This is amazing... We came to another world...!"""
st_042120_0070#0,"""Just by joining hands, he came here too. On top of that, our clothes stayed the same as the ones we were wearing on Earth."""
st_042120_0080#0,"""Aru also came here as he is... That means he's the same as me?- But Mother didn't say anything like that."""
st_042120_0090#0,"""Xiera."""
st_042120_0100#0,"""Yes yes, the ready-to-be-called Xiera is here...<br>Wai- Hitsugi, your mood tells me it's something serious..."""

st_042120_0120#0,"""Yes, we'll be waiting."""
st_042120_0130#0,"""Big sis, where are we going?"""
st_042120_0140#0,"""I'm going to find out the truth."""
st_042120_0150#0,"""It's alright, Aru. Don't worry. If anything happens, I'm always on your side."""
st_042120_0160#0,"""Okay. Even so, I could say the same thing. I'll always be on your side, big sis."""
st_042120_0170#0,"""Thank you."""
st_042120_0180#0,"""We've been waiting, Hitsugi. Also, Aru."""
st_042120_0190#0,"""1. It looks like you've calmed down."""
st_042120_0200#0,"""2. Are you forcing yourself?"""
st_042120_0210#0,"""If it looks that way, it's because I've braced myself a bit."""
st_042120_0220#0,"""To be honest, my head's still fuzzy. Everything I believed might be overturned... because I don't know anything."""
st_042120_0230#0,"""I would be lying if I said I'm not pushing myself."""
st_042120_0240#0,"""Although, I've braced myself. I'm still a bit confused, but... If I'm prepared, then I can handle anything."""

st_042120_0270#0,"""I understand. Alright Aru, can you give me your hand?"""
st_042120_0280#0,"""Confirming direct contact. Initiating direct scan... Wha-!?"""
st_042120_0290#0,"""Hitsugi!"""
st_042120_0300#0,"""1. Where's Hitsugi and Aru?"""
st_042120_0310#0,"""2. Xiera, are you alright?"""
st_042120_0320#0,"""I don't know. They just disappeared, I think."""
st_042120_0330#0,"""Y-yup. I'm fine- I was just surprised. More importantly, Hitsugi and Aru...!"""
st_042120_0340#0,"""In that moment, during the direct contact, it felt like something was pulling back, forcing the link to disconnect... Fearing our contact with Aru."""
