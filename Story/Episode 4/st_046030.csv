st_046030_0010#0,"""Say, Xiera... This is probably because Aru was absorbed by Mother, right?"""
st_046030_0020#0,"""Yes... That's likely the case."""
st_046030_0030#0,"""Continuing our previous conversation, with both of your connections now weakened, what's now within Aru is mostly darker elements."""
st_046030_0040#0,"""If we assume that Mother is using Aru's power..."""
st_046030_0050#0,"""It wouldn't be strange for the darker aspect to come out strongly."""
st_046030_0060#0,"""The fusion of Ether and Aru's darker elements..."""
st_046030_0070#0,"""From their fusion, a new type of Phantom was born... ESC-A Darkers."""
st_046030_0080#0,"""Strangely, because we saw them in person, we ended up proving our theory was true."""
st_046030_0090#0,"""If they have the same properties as darkers, this could be really bad."""
st_046030_0100#0,"""There was a previous secret incident where darkers appeared on Earth. We dealt with it, alongside ARKS, but even just a few of them caused a lot of fuss."""
st_046030_0110#0,"""These monsters that infect everything, now becoming phantoms which endlessly appear... That's not something I like to think about."""
st_046030_0120#0,"""According to the combat datas, it seems that they're not entirely darkers yet,  but..."""
st_046030_0130#0,"""That means there's not much time to waste."""
st_046030_0140#0,"""Everything is getting so screwed up because of me... I have to get Aru back as soon as possible!"""
st_046030_0150#0,"""1. Don't get too worked up"""
st_046030_0160#0,"""2. Don't push yourself too hard"""
st_046030_0170#0,"""Uh... Did you hear that just now? No, no no, it was nothing!"""
st_046030_0180#0,"""It's not nothing, you idiot. Our current situation is because you tried to handle everything yourself. Nothing good will come of that."""
st_046030_0190#0,"""Face us firmly and just spill it. Stop keeping every little thing to yourself. I'm still your big brother, you know."""
st_046030_0200#0,"""...Thank you. <%me>, big bro."""
st_046030_0210#0,"""I mean, it's just so painful and frustrating, and everything up to now is just a storm self-loathing and disgust."""
st_046030_0220#0,"""But, I will never stop. I'm not going to lose anything ever again."""
st_046030_0230#0,"""While you have a strong heart, nothing will change if you continue to carry your burdens alone. You need to rely on others more."""
st_046030_0240#0,"""Hm, if only I had a reliable person to stand by my side..."""
st_046030_0250#0,"""Yes, if only..."""
st_046030_0260#0,"""But now, you're with me. Both of you, <%me> and big bro, so everything is okay."""
st_046030_0270#0,"""No... I guess I did have someone before. There was someone I could depend on, but I was too blind to see it."""
st_046030_0280#0,"""Isn't that right, Kohri?"""
st_046030_0290#0,"""You called, Hitsugi?"""
st_046030_0300#0,"""What?!"""
st_046030_0310#0,"""I've come to pick you up, Hitsugi."""
st_046030_0320#0,"""Now, are you going to see Mother with me? And be turned back to normal? This time, for sure."""
st_046030_0330#0,"""Kohri..."""
st_046030_0340#0,"""<%me>! Ever since you arrived, Hitsugi has been acting strange... Because of you!"""
st_046030_0350#0,"""If only you weren't here... Even now, Hitsugi would be by my side!"""
