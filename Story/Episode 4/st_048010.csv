st_048010_0010#0,"""How unfortunate. I was expecting Enga and the others to understand what I was saying."""
st_048010_0020#0,"""Your opinion is one focused on the future of the Earth. It must be difficult for those fools to understand."""
st_048010_0030#0,"""Ophiel? I won't tolerate insults towards Enga or ARKS."""
st_048010_0040#0,"""Without their cooperation, we could not have come this far. You should be appreciative."""

st_048010_0080#0,"""Claiming they wouldn't accept a refusal to reply, they gave us a hard time. Sir Ardem, just what did you...?"""

st_048010_0130#0,"""But for people, that's quite a long time. ...Thank you for serving me so well."""
st_048010_0140#0,"""I-I am unworthy of such kind words! Because of Sir Ardem's guidance, we were able to learn new strengths, new reason."""
