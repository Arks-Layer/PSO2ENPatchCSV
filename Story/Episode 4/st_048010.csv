st_048010_0010#0,"""How unfortunate. I was expecting Enga and the others to understand what I was saying."""
st_048010_0020#0,"""Your opinion is one focused on the future of the Earth. It must be difficult for those fools to understand."""
st_048010_0030#0,"""Ophiel? I won't tolerate insults towards Enga or ARKS."""
st_048010_0040#0,"""Without their cooperation, we could not have come this far. You should be appreciative."""
st_048010_0050#0,"""I should not have said that. Please forgive me."""
st_048010_0060#0,"""As long as you understand."""
st_048010_0070#0,"""Sir Ardem! An inquiry from ARKS regarding Sir Ardem's actions!"""
st_048010_0080#0,"""Claiming they wouldn't accept a refusal to reply, they gave us a hard time. Sir Ardem, just what did you...?"""
st_048010_0090#0,"""There's no need for a reply. Silence will communicate my will."""
st_048010_0100#0,"""In any case, how long has it been since you joined Earth Guide?"""
st_048010_0110#0,"""It has already been 10 years since Sir Ardem has brought me here. And I've been a guard for 3 years and 4 months."""
st_048010_0120#0,"""Ah, 10 years. Simply a moment compared to the life of a star."""
st_048010_0130#0,"""But for people, that's quite a long time. ...Thank you for serving me so well."""
st_048010_0140#0,"""I-I am unworthy of such kind words! Because of Sir Ardem's guidance, we were able to learn new strengths, new reason."""
st_048010_0150#0,"""This body, this strength, is for you!"""
st_048010_0160#0,"""For me? You're mistaken. Your strength, and my strength, are all for Earth. They exist for the evolution of Earth."""

st_048010_0180#0,"""Yes... People on Earth must change. To give birth to new ideas and resurrect the creation of this world, and bring paradise back."""

st_048010_0220#0,"""It seems the vessell couldn't handle it. Evolution is quite difficult."""

st_048010_0240#0,"""By sending in Ether, I tried to embody the image of the evolution adapting to his body. Using Mother's power, of course."""

st_048010_0270#0,"""Ophiel, there are times when the vessels will survive. I know, because I've seen it over and over."""
st_048010_0280#0,"""In order for evolution to take place, there must sometimes be sacrifices. This is true of all things."""
