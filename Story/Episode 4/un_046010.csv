un_046010_0020#0,"""Yes. There's a bunch of things that need to be done, but leaving them alone isn't ok."""
un_046010_0030#0,"""ESC-A Darkers are dangerous. To be honest, they're a lot more dangerous than normal Darkers."""
un_046010_0040#0,"""Well they do have Darkers in their name, and I don't think you would ignore them either, but are ESC-A Darkers really that bad?"""
un_046010_0050#0,"""First of all, they're much more powerful than normal Darkers. Due to the fusion of Ether and Photons, they've shown strength unlike anything we've seen before."""
un_046010_0060#0,"""Furthermore, they're controlled by our enemy. And as Phantoms, they can manifest themselves anywhere."""
un_046010_0070#0,"""While Hitsugi is right in that we can't ignore them, the ones we really cannot ignore are..."""
un_046010_0080#0,"""ESC-A Darkers, right?"""
un_046010_0090#0,"""Of course, the role of ARKS is to deal with Darkers. We'll respond with all of our might. However, if we lack hands..."""
un_046010_0100#0,"""We'll come too. I'll protect everyone with this power."""
