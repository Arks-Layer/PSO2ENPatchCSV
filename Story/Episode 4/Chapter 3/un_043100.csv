un_043100_0010#0,"""Oh my! My my my! If it isn't Miss Hitsugi! Why are you wandering aimlessly all by yourself?"""
un_043100_0020#0,"""Oh. Uh... Miss Lisa, was it?"""
un_043100_0030#0,"""Yes, yes, Lisa here, how do you do?! What's the matter? Are you ready to be shot by Lisa now?"""
un_043100_0040#0,"""No, it's just... a lot of things happened..."""
un_043100_0050#0,"""A lot of things happened, and now you're ready to be shot by Lisa?"""
un_043100_0060#0,"""No, that's not it..."""
un_043100_0070#0,"""That's not it? Then what's made you look so ready to be shot?"""
un_043100_0080#0,"""...Well, you see..."""
un_043100_0090#0,"""Hm. Hm-hm. Your older brother died, you say. So that's what it is. Well, you have Lisa's sympathies."""
un_043100_0100#0,"""But, but... Lisa always wonders this. How exactly do you sympathize with other people's feelings?"""
un_043100_0110#0,"""Lisa doesn't understand the subtleties of the heart even a teeny-tiny little bit, so she likes it when people just say what's on their mind."""
un_043100_0120#0,"""So, how exactly did your brother die? If he went bang in a big explosion, I bet that would hurt! Or maybe it felt like being crushed by something?!"""
un_043100_0130#0,"""...I don't know."""
un_043100_0140#0,"""You don't know? Well, now Lisa is confused. Don't you normally say someone's dead AFTER there's been confirmation, like their body being found or something?"""
un_043100_0150#0,"""...!"""
un_043100_0160#0,"""It's not like Lisa wants to know the details or anything. Lisa's just become interested in killing things with explosions, so she was curious for future reference!"""
un_043100_0170#0,"""...Thank you so much, Miss Lisa."""
un_043100_0180#0,"""...Lisa doesn't know why she's being thanked, but she'll respond with a \""You're welcome!\"" for good measure."""
un_043100_0190#0,"""I might not be able to go see right now, and I don't know what's really happened to him, but..."""
un_043100_0200#0,"""Next time, I'll see for sure."""
un_043100_0210#0,"""...Hehe. If the sight is too much for you to bear, Lisa wouldn't mind if you called her right then and there!"""
un_043100_0220#0,"""Anyways, feel free to call on Lisa if you ever feel like being shot, okay?"""
un_043100_0230#0,"""Lisa would like to try shooting Aru as well, so if you brought him along with you, Lisa would be ever so very happy."""
un_043100_0240#0,"""...Sis?"""
un_043100_0250#0,"""Aru... and <%me>."""
un_043100_0260#0,"""Sis... um... Are you alright?"""
un_043100_0270#0,"""I'm fine, I'm fine. I just had what should've been a really disturbing conversation, but it actually kind of made me feel better."""
