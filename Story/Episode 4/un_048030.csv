un_048030_0010#0,"""Hey, <%me>, just in time. I was about to ask everyone about their embodied weapons, for future references."""
un_048030_0020#0,"""Hmm, so Hitsugi's is based upon Japanese Mythology, correct?"""
un_048030_0030#0,"""Umm, my knowledge around it is limited. However, this one is called \""Ame-no-Murakumo.\"" It's a weapon that had a strong bond with Ame-no-Habakiri."""
un_048030_0040#0,"""Kohri broke Ame-no-Habakiri. So from that image, I guess it spawned out of association."""
un_048030_0045#0,"""I was surprised when my clothes ended up transforming to match Ame-no-Murakumo... But hey, at least it fits."""
un_048030_0050#0,"""I see, it had that deep of a story. And so, Kohri's sword, which broke Ame-no-Habakiri, gives off this cursed aura."""
un_048030_0060#0,"""Uhh, t-this had that kind of story behind it and ended up gravitating towards that image..."""
un_048030_0070#0,"""To think that you would use the Cursed Sword Gram as your embodied weapon, that's totally something you would do."""
un_048030_0080#0,"""Cursed sword? What's Gram's story about?"""
un_048030_0090#0,"""If I remember correctly, it's one of those things that brings forth calamity to its wielder and everyone around them. It's also a famous dragon slaying weapon."""
un_048030_0100#0,"""Umm, y-you see... Its just that I had this impulse to just... destroy everything..."""
un_048030_0110#0,"""I'm sure that you actually enjoy these kinds of obscure stories instead of Japanese Mythology."""
un_048030_0120#0,"""I'm amazed that you all could even embody such things."""
un_048030_0130#0,"""I know they're easier to think of, but I can't comprehend pulling weapons out from mythology or folklore."""
un_048030_0140#0,"""What about you, Enga. What's your weapon based on?"""
un_048030_0150#0,"""Phantom Bullet? This was due to me thinking how much of a pain it would be, having to haul a gun around."""
un_048030_0160#0,"""In Japan, or any country really, there's all kinds of laws regarding firearms. Wouldn't you agree that it's easier to carry this around?"""
un_048030_0170#0,"""What? Is there a problem?"""
un_048030_0180#0,"""You... just lack a sense of romance."""
un_048030_0190#0,"""Eh, I guess it fits big bro's needs."""
un_048030_0200#0,"""Leave me alone."""
un_048030_0210#0,"""So embodied weapons vary on the person."""
un_048030_0220#0,"""In other words, by carefully studying these weapons, you are able to accurately guess a person's hobbies and personality. Maybe hidden desires as well?"""
un_048030_0230#0,"""You might be right. I was unaware about Kohri's desires for destruction."""
un_048030_0240#0,"""It's what I've been saying, it's a complete misunderstanding!"""
