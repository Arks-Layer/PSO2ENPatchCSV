st_048160_0060#0,"""Hmm...? Oh, Hitsugi. Mr. Aratron sent us a message."""
st_048160_0070#0,"""He says he wants you to help in the upcoming ESCA maintenance. I'll tell him \""okay!\""."""
st_048160_0080#0,"""The current Mother Cluster is hiding the absence<br>of Mother, with Mr. Aratron in charge."""
st_048160_0090#0,"""Taking on Mother's wishes, he worked hard to change<br>the organization to support Earth in secret."""
st_048160_0100#0,"""Sorry for the intrusion!"""
st_048160_0110#0,"""Oh, Enga. Wait, w-what are you doing?! Hiding in a place like that..."""
st_048160_0120#0,"""It's fine, shhh! Don't look this way, don't make it obvious. Crap!"""
st_048160_0130#0,"""Hey, 10% sexy guy! You're the only one in 3C who didn't turn in their homework! Stop running and give up!"""
st_048160_0140#0,"""He hasn't turned in his modern Japanese homework either. He probably didn't even do it. Not knowing when to give up is so uncool."""
st_048160_0150#0,"""Ah, I see... So that's what it was."""
st_048160_0160#0,"""Under the authority of Mother Cluster, Och and Phul<br>came in as teachers without any warning."""
st_048160_0170#0,"""Since they're world famous mathematicians and writers,<br>they caused quite a ruckus when they arrived,<br>but it's all blown over now."""
st_048160_0180#0,"""According to Phul, it was what Och wanted, however...<br>She seems to be enjoying herself as well."""

st_048160_0210#0,"""Target secured! Phul, if you please."""
st_048160_0220#0,"""Yes, yes. Three people to the study<br>room, let's go."""
st_048160_0230#0,"""Their abilities are being used as playthings...<br>Is that really okay?"""
st_048160_0240#0,"""I think it's a good thing. Using and mastering the abilities you have... Definitely not a bad thing."""
st_048160_0250#0,"""Wha, Ms. Phaleg?!"""
st_048160_0260#0,"""Greetings. I'm glad you two are in good health. How about a battle once you're done with work?"""
st_048160_0270#0,"""Ah, ahaha, Hitsugi and I still have a lot of work to do, so... we can't really..."""
st_048160_0280#0,"""A shame. All my opponents are too busy<br>and won't fight with me."""
st_048160_0290#0,"""I tried to invite that person as well, but<br>they won't seem to accept my challenge."""
st_048160_0300#0,"""Ms. Phaleg appears suddenly as always, from time to time.<br>I thought she'd disappear after that day, but she's still around."""

st_048160_0320#0,"""No worries. I just stopped by to ask."""
st_048160_0330#0,"""Well, whenever you feel like battling, feel free to give me a call, anytime."""
st_048160_0340#0,"""Ophiel was taken away by Ms. Phaleg,<br>and is apparently doing lots of work."""
st_048160_0350#0,"""Since it would be impossible to judge him with our system,<br>she said it would be better to make him do so much work that<br>he wished he was dead... I don't really get it."""
st_048160_0360#0,"""Argh! While we appreciate the donations, it's so hard to allocate the money properly!"""
st_048160_0370#0,"""The reason my job is never ending, and the reason the budget proposal keeps changing... is all YMT Corporation's fault!"""
st_048160_0380#0,"""I'm not sure if it was because he heard about Ophiel's treatment<br>or not, but that perverted CEO seemed to have a change of heart.<br>He apparently began working on various charity projects."""
st_048160_0390#0,"""Perhaps the reason why he sends all these donations and worked<br>to fix the Ether communication system is his way of atoning for his sins?"""
st_048160_0400#0,"""Alright! All my clerical work is done!"""
st_048160_0410#0,"""What?! Even with all that's been going on?!"""
st_048160_0420#0,"""Why do you think I've been so quiet? Kohri, what you lack is concentration!"""
st_048160_0430#0,"""Seriously... It's impossible to concentrate in such a situation..."""
st_048160_0440#0,"""I got used to it."""
st_048160_0450#0,"""Big sis! You didn't go yet, right?!"""
st_048160_0460#0,"""Aru, no running in the hall! How many times have I told you?"""
st_048160_0470#0,"""I think he just takes after you, Hitsugi."""
st_048160_0480#0,"""Shut it.<br>So, Aru, how was your first day of school?"""
st_048160_0490#0,"""Er... uhm... It was a lot of fun, and... and I'm so happy! """
st_048160_0500#0,"""Right? I forced the elementary school to let you<br>in, so you have to make at least 100 friends!"""
st_048160_0510#0,"""Okay! I'll make some for Mother too, and make at least 200 friends!"""
st_048160_0520#0,"""Aru remained here. We were hoping<br>he would... and he wanted to."""
st_048160_0530#0,"""Well, Aru, let's go."""
st_048160_0540#0,"""Yes!"""
st_048160_0550#0,"""Right, we'll all go together and-"""

st_048160_0590#0,"""Okay!"""
st_048160_0600#0,"""ARKS... The ARKS ship remained in their universe after that incident."""
st_048160_0610#0,"""Perhaps they decided this world was saved, and didn't want to interfere where they didn't need to, aside from dealing with Phantoms?"""
st_048160_0620#0,"""I haven't met them ever since that day... Since I had tons of things to do when I got back, I haven't gotten a chance to visit."""
st_048160_0630#0,"""Maybe they realized how busy we were, they haven't visited us either..."""
st_048160_0640#0,"""I wanted them to give us some attention, but... I guess that's okay."""
st_048160_0650#0,"""It'll just be a bigger surprise that way."""
st_048160_0660#0,"""Okay."""
st_048160_0670#0,"""Who dares enter the management room without an appoi-... Hitsugi! Aru too!"""
st_048160_0680#0,"""Wow! It's been so long! Today's a special day, suddenly arriving and surprising us! I would have sent an escort if I'd known."""
st_048160_0690#0,"""Ah, that expression. I know who you're looking for, say no more."""
st_048160_0700#0,"""Hey, come up and say hello!"""
