un_045070_0030#0,"""But we had great luck, didn't we? ARKS came to the rescue, and we're getting all kinds of help!"""
un_045070_0040#0,"""Why were you traveling through subspace?"""
un_045070_0050#0,"""Wasn't it scary?"""
un_045070_0060#0,"""\""Why, because I wanted to go to the end of subspace!\"" would be a little too loose an explanation, I guess?"""
un_045070_0070#0,"""Hmm, yeah... I'd be lying if I said it wasn't scary, but we had an objective in mind, y'know?"""

un_045070_0130#0,"""...That's right! I've got to pick myself up, and get back out there into subspace pronto! I'm gonna go meet 'em!"""
un_045070_0140#0,"""That would be the most like me! So that's the plan, let's get to it!"""
