un_045080_0010#0,"""Yeah... Going by what I saw remotely, the area around the output device looks suspicious, but the circuits look fried or something, too."""
un_045080_0020#0,"""If so, then we won't just need a scientist. We might also need to ask for help from someone who knows a lot about engineering..."""
un_045080_0030#0,"""Ahh, but... going by the blueprints, we shouldn't need to change the circuits themselves. Maybe we can work out some kind of bypass?"""
un_045080_0040#0,"""You're actually pretty smart, huh?"""
un_045080_0050#0,"""Playing scientist, are we?"""
un_045080_0060#0,"""What are you on about? You didn't know that I designed both the theory of subspace navigation and the ship for navigating it?"""
un_045080_0070#0,"""Wrong! I'm not playing anything. I AM a scientist!"""
un_045080_0080#0,"""I wrote the book on subspace navigation AND designed the ship for navigating it! Well, technically there was another person involved, but..."""
un_045080_0090#0,"""Umm... yeah. Almost everything Emilia is saying is true."""
un_045080_0100#0,"""And what was that little hesitation about? Unbelievable..."""
un_045080_0110#0,"""If I didn't have this problem to deal with, I would've wanted to check out some more things on the ARKS Ship and mess around some more."""
un_045080_0120#0,"""That said, staring at those design specs sure did take a lot out of me... Maybe a little tinkering will help me relax..."""
un_045080_0130#0,"""D-don't do that! Remodeling without permission is absolutely prohibited!"""
un_045080_0140#0,"""Ehhh? It's fine, it's fine. Nothing bad's going to happen from me making improvements!"""
un_045080_0150#0,"""...Oh yeah! Vivienne, if we use the materials we got, maybe we can get that body of yours looking a pure, totally spotless white!"""
un_045080_0160#0,"""Sooo... let's find help! Let's go ask everyone for some help!"""
un_045080_0170#0,"""Ahh, c'mon, wait up Vivienne!<br>...What a waste of those materials! I thought it'd look really cool!"""
