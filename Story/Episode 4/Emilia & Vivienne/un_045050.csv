un_045050_0010#0,"""Mmm... ah! They're here! Welcome back!"""
un_045050_0020#0,"""Haaa, thanks! I was all flustered right after the accident. If you hadn't been there for me..."""
un_045050_0030#0,"""U-um, Emilia."""
un_045050_0040#0,"""Huh? What's wrong, Vivienne?"""
un_045050_0050#0,"""They look a little taken aback. Let's introduce ourselves first."""
un_045050_0060#0,"""Ah yes, right, that's right. Mmkay, one more time... My name's Emilia Percival."""
un_045050_0070#0,"""My name is Vivienne. Thank you so very much for helping us, even though you'd never met us before."""
un_045050_0080#0,"""We are... How can I word this...?<br>We're residents of another world, I guess. To put it another way, we're visitors from subspace."""
un_045050_0090#0,"""Our ship suddenly started breaking down on us while we were navigating through subspace, you see."""
un_045050_0100#0,"""We ended up having to make an emergency landing on that planet. Naberius, was it?"""
un_045050_0110#0,"""It's a good thing we were already prepared for such a situation! I always say, \""You can never be too ready!\"""""
un_045050_0120#0,"""Although I'd prefer if we made sure we never needed to make emergency landings, rather than always preparing for them..."""
un_045050_0130#0,"""The ship itself is hidden really well on Naberius, so it should be okay for a while."""
un_045050_0140#0,"""But the shock of the forced landing broke a whole bunch of vital stuff, so we're not going anywhere until it's all fixed up."""
un_045050_0150#0,"""Which meeeaaannns...<br>We're gonna be staying here until we manage to repair our ship!"""
un_045050_0160#0,"""We don't want to take too much advantage of the Administrator's kindness...<br>But I hope you'll come to our aid."""
