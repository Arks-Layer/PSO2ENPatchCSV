un_045090_0020#0,"""See, I sensed that they would! Now do you believe me?"""
un_045090_0030#0,"""You sensed it...? I just don't get it at all."""
un_045090_0040#0,"""Well, just now Vivienne had this feeling that a certain someone was coming, and it turns out she was right on the mark. Spooky!"""
un_045090_0050#0,"""*sniff sniff* You don't have any particular odor or anything, right?"""
un_045090_0060#0,"""Th-that's not it at all. It's a sensation! A sensation."""
un_045090_0070#0,"""What kind of 'sensation' are we talking about exactly?"""
un_045090_0080#0,"""What's the trick?"""
un_045090_0090#0,"""I'm afraid explaining it properly would be rather difficult...<br>All I can say is that I sensed it."""

un_045090_0110#0,"""Like, that person's presence? It's like the air is telling me, 'they're right over there...'"""
un_045090_0120#0,"""...Well, for example, what do you feel when our friend here is getting closer?"""
un_045090_0130#0,"""Hmm, how can I put it? Like, a really, really big sensation? A kind presence that's watching over us."""
un_045090_0140#0,"""A really... big sensation? A kind... presence... yeah..."""
un_045090_0150#0,"""...It's no good! I! Don't! Get! It! At! All!"""
un_045090_0160#0,"""There's no need to rush, Emilia. I'm sure you'll be able to pick it up eventually."""
un_045090_0170#0,"""Tsk, if I could tell someone's coming ahead of time, I could touch up my makeup or ghost 'em, depending on who it was. It'd be so handy."""
