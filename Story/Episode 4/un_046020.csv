un_046020_0020#0,"""I ended up waking earlier than you, and they've been moving me everywhere since I did... It feels like its been forever!"""
un_046020_0030#0,"""Haha, it really has been a long time... I'm kind of lost, to be honest. What should I talk about first?"""
un_046020_0040#0,"""Oh, let's start with recent events!"""
un_046020_0050#0,"""Thanks for coming to my rescue. At that time, I was the only one who could fight. To tell you the truth, I was a bit scared."""
un_046020_0060#0,"""1. It's thanks to Hitsugi"""
un_046020_0070#0,"""2. You did a good job"""
un_046020_0080#0,"""Yep! Because Hitsugi opened a path, <%me> was able to come help me."""
un_046020_0090#0,"""...Mhmm, I tried. I did the best that I could."""
un_046020_0100#0,"""We were able to make it because everyone worked together. <%me> and Hitsugi too... I'm glad you came back."""
un_046020_0110#0,"""I had intended to encourage Hitsugi, but it seems to have backfired... I was really worried."""
un_046020_0120#0,"""But, she was able to come back... and she really had determination in her eyes."""
un_046020_0130#0,"""So, from now on, we have to properly support her so that she won't handle everything alone."""
un_046020_0140#0,"""Hey... you just looked my way, didn't you? You were thinking about the old me?"""
un_046020_0150#0,"""It's okay, I won't get lost again. If something happens, I'll definitely rely on you, <%me>."""
un_046020_0160#0,"""I'm not alone anymore... I'll never forget that."""
