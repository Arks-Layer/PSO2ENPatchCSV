un_046025_0010#0,"""Oh, what perfect timing. I was just thinking that I wanted to talk."""
un_046025_0020#0,"""A corrupted area appeared on Amduscia. You know about it, right?"""
un_046025_0030#0,"""The reason it became like that... it might be my fault."""
un_046025_0040#0,"""You've heard about it, right, <%me>?"""
un_046025_0050#0,"""That time when Aika almost became a Dark Falz."""
un_046025_0060#0,"""The Apprentice darkness that I took in... they... Dio Hunar took it away for us."""
un_046025_0070#0,"""I think that event was the trigger that caused Amduscia to start becoming corrupted..."""
un_046025_0080#0,"""The reason corrupted areas began to appear on Naberius and Lillipa was because of Dark Falz and the Profound Darkness..."""
un_046025_0090#0,"""Oh, I'm sorry... I'm okay, I'm all right."""
un_046025_0100#0,"""I was able to help Aika, and I don't regret it at all. Really."""
un_046025_0110#0,"""While I do think back on all the trouble I've caused people... I don't regret it."""
un_046025_0120#0,"""No matter what happened as a result of that event, I believe I did the best I possibly could."""
un_046025_0130#0,"""But... Xiao and Xiera seem to see things slightly different."""
un_046025_0140#0,"""If it was caused by the event involving me and Aika, it's strange that it didn't appear around that time."""
un_046025_0150#0,"""Even if it was one of the causes, they said there had to be more to it."""
un_046025_0160#0,"""But when we look at recent events, there's not much happening lately."""
un_046025_0170#0,"""1. The ARKS Mothership was invaded the other day."""
un_046025_0180#0,"""2. I met with Matoi again."""
un_046025_0190#0,"""...Right. The people of Earth... and Mother's invasion. The fusion of Photons and Ether..."""
un_046025_0200#0,"""I think that may be one of the causes as well. It fits perfectly, time-wise."""
un_046025_0210#0,"""W-What?! Caused by our reunion?!"""
un_046025_0220#0,"""I-I think you misunderstood what I meant... I mean..."""
un_046025_0230#0,"""N-No, there's no way that's it!"""
un_046025_0240#0,"""In any case, Xiao is thinking that one of the causes may be Mother's attack the other day."""
un_046025_0250#0,"""Maybe this fusion of Photons and Ether had an effect on the Profound Darkness..."""
un_046025_0260#0,"""Either way, we'll have to try our best, <%me>."""
