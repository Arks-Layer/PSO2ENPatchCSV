st_044075_0010#0,"""Speaking of which, Las Vegas has come under multiple attacks but... why hasn't Mother attacked directly underground?"""
st_044075_0020#0,"""Looking back on Bethor’s behavior, I was expecting explosions underground. It's a bit unexpected, or rather... terrifying."""
st_044075_0030#0,"""It just means that the director’s rampage in Tokyo was just an exception. That also seems likely as to why he was purged."""
st_044075_0040#0,"""Indeed... Mother Cluster seems to avoid taking actions that harm Earth itself. We've witnessed this often."""
st_044075_0050#0,"""And even if they wanted to attack, they may not know the exact location underground."""
st_044075_0060#0,"""In other words, instead of causing large scale destruction, it’s faster to lure us out with small outbursts."""
st_044075_0070#0,"""That said, they’re ambushing us again and again... It wouldn't be strange if they’ve grown tired of this by now."""

st_044075_0110#0,"""Enga... I know I can't change your mind, but... be careful."""
st_044075_0120#0,"""If you're going to encourage me, at least do it honestly, huh?"""
st_044075_0130#0,"""Big bro, I'm coming too!"""
st_044075_0140#0,"""You're going to be fighting people. This is different from the fight against Bethor."""
st_044075_0150#0,"""This is a real fight. Can you really do it? Can you cut down and kill another person?"""
st_044075_0160#0,"""O-Of course! I'll take down every last member of Mother Cluster!"""
