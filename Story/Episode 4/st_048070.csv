st_048070_0010#0,"""The bodies of the Earth Guide members are changing... As a result of forced evolution?"""
st_048070_0020#0,"""I don't want to believe it but... <%me>, you saw them change into a Phantom right before your eyes?"""
st_048070_0030#0,"""Forcing evolution upon a living body, and turning it into a monster... That sounds like darkers."""
st_048070_0040#0,"""Indeed, it's quite ironic when you consider that darkers were also created from Photons."""
st_048070_0050#0,"""<%me>'s report came almost the exact time the amount of Ether on Earth started increasing."""
st_048070_0060#0,"""It's almost like the Earth itself is producing it... It's very unusual, to say the least."""
st_048070_0070#0,"""Along with the increase of Ether, the number of Phantoms appearing is skyrocketing as well."""
st_048070_0080#0,"""We're cooperating with the other branches of Earth Guide, while Matoi and the Council of Six are helping them."""
st_048070_0090#0,"""However... We're not making a dent in their numbers. They are actually increasing, with no end in sight."""
st_048070_0100#0,"""The Ether is... screaming. That it will be forcibly changed... changing the entire planet itself."""
st_048070_0110#0,"""Why is covering everything with Ether? What you could possibly need to cover the entire planet to embody?"""
st_048070_0120#0,"""I'm sure the absence of God in modern times, and the loss of that paradise, are unforgivable to that man."""
st_048070_0130#0,"""Maybe... the embodiment of God? Mr. Ardem seemed to act like he was a god."""
st_048070_0140#0,"""...The embodiment of God."""
st_048070_0150#0,"""Uh, uhm, Hitsugi? That was supposed to be a joke, but..."""
st_048070_0160#0,"""To guide the Earth, seek further evolution, reform the world and create it anew."""
st_048070_0170#0,"""The fastest way for that guy to do that... That'd pretty much be the embodiment of the God of Genesis, wouldn't it?"""
st_048070_0180#0,"""The God of Genesis, no way... That's the stuff of legends and myths, right? Hitsugi, fairy tales like that can't possibly..."""
st_048070_0190#0,"""But we're currently embodying fairy tales ourselves."""
st_048070_0200#0,"""...Very true."""
st_048070_0210#0,"""1. We have to stop Ardem"""
st_048070_0220#0,"""2. What do you want to do, Enga?"""
st_048070_0230#0,"""Of course. I don't care if he's trying to guide the Earth, or our evolution. I'm not going to let him do whatever he wants."""
st_048070_0240#0,"""...I have to stop him. To think I helped cause what's going on all over the planet... I have to make it right."""
st_048070_0250#0,"""But I lack the strength to do so myself. Even borrowing the strength of Histugi and the others, it wouldn't be enough."""
st_048070_0260#0,"""So, please lend me your strength, <%me>."""
st_048070_0270#0,"""The people of Earth really do have a strong sense of responsibility? Or perhaps it's just your morals?"""
st_048070_0280#0,"""Of course, we will cooperate with all we can. ARKS' goal is not only the extermination of darkers, but to survey and protect each planet too!"""
