un_043020_0010#0,"""Oh, <%me>! You seem to have been pretty busy despite recently being reinstated. So, are things starting to calm down?"""
un_043020_0020#0,"""1. You seem to be busy yourself"""
un_043020_0030#0,"""2. Who are you again?"""
un_043020_0040#0,"""Well yeah, but I think it's a good thing to have something to do."""
un_043020_0050#0,"""I'm just a bit annoyed that these jobs are coming from that wily four-eyes though."""
un_043020_0060#0,"""Wow, rude! Don't tell me you've forgotten all about such an adorable idol as me? Sob, sob."""
un_043020_0070#0,"""……Knowing you, I was afraid you were being serious,<br>but you're just joking, right...?<br>You better not forget about me for real though!"""
un_043020_0080#0,"""Wait, I know this person! The Idol of ARKS who always does the live concerts!"""
un_043020_0090#0,"""Hm? Oh! I apologize for not greeting you sooner! I'm Quna! Nice to meet you! And you are...?"""
un_043020_0100#0,"""Ahh, ah, I'm H-Hitsugi! Nice to meet you as well!"""
un_043020_0110#0,"""I um, I always listen to your concerts all the time! I-I really like them!"""
un_043020_0120#0,"""Thank you! It's times like this which make me glad I'm an idol!"""
un_043020_0130#0,"""<%me>, on the other hand, occasionally comes and watches, but hardly gives any thoughts on it."""
un_043020_0140#0,"""Hey big sis, what's an idol? What do they do?"""
un_043020_0150#0,"""Huh? The job of an idol? Umm..."""
un_043020_0160#0,"""The number one job of an idol is to put a smile on everyone's faces!"""
un_043020_0170#0,"""With this body, this voice, and this heart, tell them that no one is alone, that everyone is always together. So the people of ARKS are never lonely."""
un_043020_0180#0,"""Keeping telling everyone that they're always together... so they are never lonely?"""
un_043020_0190#0,"""Right. That's because there are limits to what one can accomplish on their own. But if everyone is together, something can be done about it."""
un_043020_0200#0,"""Of course, there are those who try to do anything and everything by themselves. It's always so hard to follow them, you know."""
un_043020_0210#0,"""Damn! I just remembered that I have to prepare for the next concert!"""
un_043020_0220#0,"""<%me>! Come see my next concert! See you all later!"""
un_043020_0230#0,"""Even an idol like that just comes and openheartedly talks to you... Are you more of a big-shot than I imagined?"""
