un_047040_0020#0,"""I'm just about to go on a date with Predecessor! Isn't that nice! Jealous, right?"""
un_047040_0030#0,"""I-It's not a date! I'm just helping out with some training! """
un_047040_0040#0,"""When you became my training partner, average opponents just doesn't cut it anymore! I sometimes ask Predecessor to be my opponent!"""
un_047040_0050#0,"""Claris Claes doesn't hold back; You can't help it if they get frightened."""
un_047040_0060#0,"""There's no point in holding back during training. Figuring out your true strength is the training after all."""
un_047040_0070#0,"""That is a valid argument, but it can also be meaningful for them to gain confidence too. I think it's sometimes good to play the role of the defeatist?"""
un_047040_0080#0,"""Defeatist role? Is Predecessor just acting then too? Wait, even during our training sessions?"""
un_047040_0090#0,"""Ah... no, erm... I give my best! I always give my best! Yup! Isn't that right, <%me>!"""
un_047040_0100#0,"""1. You're a terrible liar."""

un_047040_0130#0,"""Predecessor... Even I could figure that one out."""
un_047040_0150#0,"""Just like in the old days... You don't have to be unreasonable with my request."""
un_047040_0160#0,"""My abilities are inferior to the predecessor to begin with. It can't be helped if she was holding back."""
un_047040_0170#0,"""But, regardless of what Predecessor is doing, it's a fact that I'm fighting on par with Predecessor. That means, Predecessor and I are equals!"""
un_047040_0180#0,"""I couldn't care less about the convenience of others. As Huey said, \""Win and you're strong, lose and you're weak, and that's all that matters\"", and I think so too."""
un_047040_0190#0,"""Yes, you're right, Claris Claes."""
un_047040_0200#0,"""However, if she was going easy on me, that alone annoys me!"""
un_047040_0210#0,"""Alright, Predecessor! For today's duel, no going easy and no holding back! Got it? You must!"""
un_047040_0220#0,"""Eh... but..."""
un_047040_0230#0,"""You must!"""
un_047040_0240#0,"""Ok, you've won. Today, I'll give my best like never before!"""
