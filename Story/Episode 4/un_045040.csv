un_045040_0010#0,"""...As I've said, when making a new class, you must receive the blessings of the other classes!"""
un_045040_0020#0,"""Using the allure and cuteness of that and endangering the Bouncer class... Even if ARKS forgives you, I will not!"""
un_045040_0030#0,"""Even if you say that, there's still a problem. Summoner is already approved by ARKS. Isn't it too late to take it back?"""
un_045040_0040#0,"""Besides, she's the one who won't let me go! Isn't that right! Catherine!"""
un_045040_0050#0,"""Ahaha, it hurts, it hurts Catherine!"""
un_045040_0060#0,"""O-oh...how, very cute..."""
un_045040_0070#0,"""Wait! No, you can't be seduced by this display of affection, Katori! It would be a disgrace to the Bouncer class!"""
un_045040_0080#0,"""Oh, it's you. Don't worry, there's no issues here."""
un_045040_0090#0,"""Katori just has personal complaints about the Summoner class."""
un_045040_0100#0,"""Summoner, right? It's an interesting experimental class. However, I don't have an interest in having beasts fight for me."""
un_045040_0110#0,"""Also, the timing in which the class was approved is amazing. Had it been approved before Katori was chosen as class leader for Bouncer, it would have been difficult to deal with."""
un_045040_0120#0,"""While her laziness has not changed. Her way of thinking \""I don't fight = I can take it easy!\"" She would definitely have taken up Summoner."""
un_045040_0130#0,"""But now her mastery with Bouncer has improved, it would be a waste to let that skill go."""
un_045040_0140#0,"""However, she's complaining that Summoner allows you to be laid back. And that's pretty much it."""
un_045040_0150#0,"""Saga, don't you have anything to say!? This has to do with the honor of Bouncers!"""
un_045040_0160#0,"""Because Summoner is a class of laziness. It's not fair at all!"""
un_045040_0170#0,"""Stop spreading rumors."""
un_045040_0180#0,"""Oh, <%me>! Could you give some input too? Please <%me>!"""
un_045040_0190#0,"""Oh, if it isn't my friend! Look, Catherine is doing well too! How are your children, are they doing well too?"""
un_045040_0200#0,"""Huh, My Friend..?! It's not possible, <%me> has fallen prey to Summoner's black magic...!?"""
un_045040_0210#0,"""<%me>! What's the meaning of this! Even if you could have myself, you still chose Summoner over.... Bouncer!?"""
un_045040_0220#0,"""Depending on your answer, maybe there's the possibility that I could also be a Summoner too! Right Saga?!"""
un_045040_0230#0,"""Denied.<br>Now, it's time to start your training Katori."""
un_045040_0240#0,"""Wait, I wasn't finished yet... Rather, I wish I could have freedom in my choice of class as well! Freedom!"""
un_045040_0250#0,"""This is your duty as the representative of the Bouncer class. If you want freedom of choice, then complete your duties first."""
un_045040_0260#0,"""But training doesn't equal duties, this doesn't make any sense!"""
un_045040_0270#0,"""Haha, what a energetic person, right Catherine!? She was rather harsh on her critque, however! But I'll never give you up, I'll never let yo--"""
un_045040_0280#0,"""Waaah, Catherine, I know you're excited! But could you stop attacking my leg! Ow, that hurts! Ah, stop!"""
