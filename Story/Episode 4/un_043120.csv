un_043120_0010#0,"""Hey, my friend! I've heard rumors of your latest achievements. You appear to be leading a great Summoner's life."""
un_043120_0020#0,"""W-Wait, my friend, wait! It's not nice to ignore your friends. Friends are the most important aspect of life, after all."""
un_043120_0030#0,"""Isn't that right, Elizabeth? Don't you agree? Hahahahaha!"""
un_043120_0040#0,"""Oh, my friend, how rude of me. I haven't introduced you to her yet. She is my beloved Elizabeth. Cute, right?"""
un_043120_0050#0,"""1. You love more than one of them?"""
un_043120_0060#0,"""2. What happened to the one I saw before?"""
un_043120_0070#0,"""That's a foolish question, my friend. I love each and every one of them equally. How there are is not an issue."""
un_043120_0080#0,"""You mean Josephine? She's resting at the moment."""
un_043120_0090#0,"""Work hard, rest hard! And so shall our love set the fields ablaze! For that is the very essence that keeps these children of mine afloat!"""
un_043120_0100#0,"""My three beloved children - Catherine, Josephine, and Elizabeth."""
un_043120_0110#0,"""They are the remarkable pet types Summoners can currently utilize."""
un_043120_0120#0,"""Catherine is the quadrupedal type, Josephine is the aerial type, and Elizabeth is the bipedal type."""
un_043120_0130#0,"""It isn't just their appearances that differ. Different types have unique characteristics. That is what makes them so irresistibly cute and lovable."""
un_043120_0140#0,"""It's just not possible to choose one! That is why I love Catherine, Josephine and Elizabeth, all equally!"""
un_043120_0150#0,"""Ahaha, Elizabeth! I know, I know, you love me as well!"""
un_043120_0160#0,"""Oh, that's not good Elizabeth... you see, the human arm isn't supposed to bend that way! It's also rude to claw at someone's head! Hahaha!"""
un_043120_0170#0,"""Oh, look at the time - it's almost dinner! Let's go prepare, shall we, Elizabeth?"""
un_043120_0180#0,"""Hahaha, like I said before, I'm not food..."""
