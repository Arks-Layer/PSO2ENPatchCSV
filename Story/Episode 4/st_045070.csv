st_045070_0010#0,"""Hitsugi!"""
st_045070_0020#0,"""Hey, Hitsugi, get a hold of yourself!"""
st_045070_0030#0,"""Impossible, simply impossible. Useless, completely useless. That kid's heart is 99% dead, after all. She won't move a muscle, too bad."""
st_045070_0040#0,"""Even though we took her, she's just a burden. While that Kohri girl might get angry, she'll get over it. We don't need her anymore."""
st_045070_0050#0,"""Her heart is... dead? What did you bastards do to Hitsugi?!"""
st_045070_0060#0,"""We didn't do anything... She became like that because you left her behind in your story."""
st_045070_0070#0,"""That girl's heart is fragile, weak, and easy to break. To not realize this... you're a failure of a man."""
st_045070_0080#0,"""In the end, we managed to lure you here, so she's served her purpose 100%."""
st_045070_0090#0,"""1. Lured us here?"""
st_045070_0100#0,"""2. Hitsugi served her purpose?"""
st_045070_0110#0,"""Indeed, the fight we just had... The time we're spending talking to you now... It was all just to stall for time."""
st_045070_0120#0,"""Yes, Hitsugi's purpose was to draw out ARKS most powerful weapon, <%me>... To be bait for you."""
st_045070_0130#0,"""This entire battle... our talk now... a 100% way to stall for time!"""
st_045070_0140#0,"""What...?"""
st_045070_0150#0,"""<%me>! Enga! I'm so glad I finally got through to you!"""
st_045070_0160#0,"""It's an emergency! There's an enemy assault on the ARKS ship! Without going through PSO2, the enemy invaded our side and has taken over control!"""
st_045070_0170#0,"""At the same time, they sent over their army... There are phantoms within the ARKS ship!"""
st_045070_0180#0,"""But... how did they get past the barrier without us noticing? To have taken authority over the management of the ARKS ship... They'd have to be an entity greater than Xiao.... Ah!"""
st_045070_0190#0,"""Hey, Xiera?! Xiera?!"""
st_045070_0200#0,"""Fufu, it's all going according to Och's plan. According to her calculations. Amazing."""
st_045070_0210#0,"""<%me>... ARKS greatest warrior... stronger than anyone... and so very naive."""
st_045070_0220#0,"""If we took a prisoner, you would come to rescue them with a small force. Among those, <%me> would definitely be included."""
st_045070_0230#0,"""Fufu, 100% correct, as usual. I'd expect nothing less from myself, the phenomenal genius mathematician, Och Miller."""
st_045070_0240#0,"""\""How long have they been planning this?!\"" I'll go ahead and answer the question you're thinking, big brother."""
st_045070_0250#0,"""From the very beginning. The big brother who refused to look at his sister..."""
st_045070_0260#0,"""And now, we're 80% done serving our purpose."""
st_045070_0270#0,"""Yeah, I think we're okay now. It should be enough, counting the time looping."""
st_045070_0280#0,"""...I did want to make mother more happy."""
st_045070_0290#0,"""Hehe... I feel 100% the same way, Phul."""
st_045070_0300#0,"""Why would you both go so far...?"""
st_045070_0310#0,"""You wouldn't understand, 30% sexy guy. No one other than Phul would."""
st_045070_0320#0,"""...Och and I know, so it's okay. That's all we need."""
st_045070_0330#0,"""Mother gave color to our world. There's no reason besides that. That's more than enough for us."""
st_045070_0340#0,"""...Damn! <%me>, over here. We'll use the portal!"""
st_045070_0350#0,"""We didn't really have time to test it, but it seems to have worked..."""
st_045070_0360#0,"""Transportation magic through a portal. You can only warp to the place where you put the exit. It's a one-time emergency escape."""
st_045070_0370#0,"""It was supposed to be used to send my stupid little sister back after she'd demand to stay and help, but... it was unexpectedly useful."""
st_045070_0380#0,"""You wouldn't understand, 30% sexy guy. No one other than Phul would."""
st_045070_0390#0,"""...Och and I know, so it's okay. That's all we need."""
st_045070_0400#0,"""Don't give me that crap... You apostles were refusing to understand, you idiots..."""
st_045070_0410#0,"""In any case, the ARKS Ship.  We need to find a way back there..."""
st_045070_0420#0,"""What?! The ARKS ship has disappeared?! What's going on?!"""
