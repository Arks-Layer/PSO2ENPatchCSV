st_045040_0010#0,"""That Mother Cluster... building something so gigantic on the moon."""
st_045040_0020#0,"""According to information from Ardem, this location was once used to spread Ether across the world."""
st_045040_0030#0,"""Under the cooperation of various nations, even after Ether was dispersed, transportation of raw materials continued to take place. The reason why is unclear."""
st_045040_0040#0,"""Seems like everyone has been blowing money on this."""
st_045040_0050#0,"""Not only is the air here breathable, but the gravity is fully controlled. They've been hiding some insane technology."""
st_045040_0060#0,"""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic... I wonder which one this is?"""
st_045040_0070#0,"""1. It's clearly science."""
st_045040_0080#0,"""2. Perhaps its magic?"""
st_045040_0090#0,"""Of course. When it comes to technology like this, only Mother Cluster could have done it."""
st_045040_0100#0,"""You could use magic to create the materials, but I don't know of a way to control gravity using magic... I think it's probably science."""
st_045040_0110#0,"""Regardless of materials, this level of science is far beyond anything on Earth. Even using Ether."""
st_045040_0120#0,"""I wonder... did Mother Cluster invade the ARKS universe in order to steal this sort of technology?"""

st_045040_0140#0,"""I'm trying to locate Hitsugi's signal, but scanners there are being jammed, so it's not going very well."""
