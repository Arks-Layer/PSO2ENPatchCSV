st_042090_0010#0,"""And that completes our tasks for the day. The paperwork keeps piling up as the entrance ceremony draws nearer, doesn't it Hitsugi."""
st_042090_0020#0,"""On top of that, even more is expected of us since we're boarding students."""
st_042090_0030#0,"""But but, thanks to that we get to have the room all to ourselves. Not a bad deal, I guess?"""
st_042090_0040#0,"""Just kidding! Almost got you there, Hitsugi!"""
st_042090_0050#0,"""..."""
st_042090_0060#0,"""Hitsugi?"""
st_042090_0070#0,"""PSO2 is just a game. Mother told us so."""
st_042090_0080#0,"""If that's true, does that mean everyone I've met was a fake?"""
st_042090_0090#0,"""Hitsugi?"""
st_042090_0100#0,"""If that's true, then what exactly is Aru? He was brought over here, and we cared for each other. Is that all fake?"""
st_042090_0110#0,"""Hi-tsu-gi."""
st_042090_0120#0,"""No, it's not just Aru... The person who's worried about me, Xiera. <%me> too..."""
st_042090_0130#0,"""Do they really exist..? ...But, that's not what Mother told us."""

st_042090_0150#0,"""Uwaah! Ah, Kohri... What's wrong?"""
st_042090_0160#0,"""That's my line! I kept calling and you didn't respond. You haven't finished your work, either."""
st_042090_0170#0,"""..Sorry."""
st_042090_0180#0,"""What's wrong Hitsugi? You've been acting strange lately. It's not like you."""
st_042090_0190#0,"""I'm not myself, huh. Was I acting that strangely?"""
st_042090_0200#0,"""Yup, that's right! It's really unlike you Hitsugi! It's like someone else in a Hitsugi bodysuit!"""
st_042090_0210#0,"""The Hitsugi I know never hesitates or worries about anything! She's the kind of person who makes decisions on the go and never stops!"""
st_042090_0220#0,"""You never cared about what people say about you or the results of your efforts! Always surprising everyone with what you have!"""
st_042090_0230#0,"""Was that from the previous school clubs budget meeting?"""
st_042090_0240#0,"""Nope, during the freshman welcoming meeting."""

st_042090_0270#0,"""That's why you need to stop worrying, Hitsugi. I don't want to see you worrying. I want you to keep pushing forward...!"""
st_042090_0280#0,"""Thanks, Kohri."""
st_042090_0290#0,"""You're right, Kohri. All this thinking and worrying isn't me at all."""
st_042090_0300#0,"""Alright, this calls for a change of pace! Hey Kohri, let's hang out tomorrow! We'll bring Aru along and party hard!"""
st_042090_0310#0,"""Yeah!"""
st_042090_0320#0,"""Hitsugi and Kohri... It's great that they trust each other so much."""
