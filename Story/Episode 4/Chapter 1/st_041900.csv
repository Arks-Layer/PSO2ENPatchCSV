st_041900_0020#0,"""While you were out of action, ARKS' command chain has gone through a drastic restructuring."""
st_041900_0030#0,"""Firstly, the Commander... Ulc is one of ARKS greatest people. Theodore acts as her assistant."""
st_041900_0040#0,"""The Council of Six has been divided into different parts."""
st_041900_0050#0,"""Commander of the Combat Division, Huey. Deputy, 3rd generation Claris Claes."""
st_041900_0060#0,"""Commander of the General Affairs Department, Maria. Deputy, Sara"""
st_041900_0070#0,"""Commander of the Instructor Division, Regius. Deputy, Zeno."""
st_041900_0080#0,"""And then, when there are many problems, it's up to the Commander of the Intelligence Division, Casra."""
st_041900_0090#0,"""Decision-making that involves the overall policy of ARKS will be thoroughly discussed among the Head of Departments and the Commander first."""
st_041900_0100#0,"""Having set this up, our Ship Administrator, Xiao, has returned to the Mothership to concentrate on calculation."""

st_041900_0120#0,"""Truth be told, I'm amazed! It's been two years since I was born, and I'm already an adult in both mind and body! Hehe!"""
st_041900_0130#0,"""By the way, I heard from Xiao that Commander Ulc had a part in forming my personality."""
st_041900_0140#0,"""Also, there's one more special title within ARKS. It's called \""The Guardian\""."""
st_041900_0150#0,"""Guardians are the only ones in ARKS who don't belong to a department, and can decide what they want to do for themselves."""
st_041900_0160#0,"""There are currently two Guardians: you and Matoi!"""
