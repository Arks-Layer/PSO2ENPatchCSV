st_041900_0010#0,"""Okay, here's the gist of things:"""
st_041900_0020#0,"""While you were out of action, ARKS' command chain has gone through a drastic restructuring."""
st_041900_0030#0,"""Firstly, the Commander... The most important person in all of ARKS is Ulc. Theodore acts as her Deputy."""
st_041900_0040#0,"""The Council of Six has been divided into different parts."""
st_041900_0050#0,"""Commander of the Combat Division, Huey. Deputy, 3rd generation Claris Claes."""
st_041900_0060#0,"""Commander of the General Affairs Division, Maria. Deputy, Sara."""
st_041900_0070#0,"""Commander of the Instructor Division, Regius. Deputy, Zeno."""
st_041900_0080#0,"""And the Commander of the Intelligence Division, the one who's been causing problems for Ulc, would be Casra."""
st_041900_0090#0,"""Decisions that involve overall ARKS policy are made collectively between the various Commanders and the Commander-in-chief."""
st_041900_0100#0,"""Having set this up, our Ship Administrator, Xiao, has returned to the Mothership to concentrate on calculation."""
st_041900_0110#0,"""That's right, we're the ones running the ship in Xiao's place!"""
st_041900_0120#0,"""Hehe, but the most amazing part might be me. It's only been two years since I was born, but I was an adult in both mind and body from day one! Hehe!"""
st_041900_0130#0,"""By the way, I heard from Xiao that Commander Ulc was the basis for my personality."""
st_041900_0140#0,"""Also, there's one more special title within ARKS. It's called \""Guardian\""."""
st_041900_0150#0,"""Guardians are the only ones in ARKS who don't belong to a Division, and can decide what they want to do for themselves."""
st_041900_0160#0,"""There are currently two Guardians: you and Matoi!"""
st_041900_0170#0,"""Not only that, but I'm the personal operator for the Guardian, <%me>."""
st_041900_0180#0,"""That's the end of the explanation. I'm looking forward to working with you."""
