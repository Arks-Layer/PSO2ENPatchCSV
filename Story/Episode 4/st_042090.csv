st_042090_0020#0,"""On top of that, even more is expected of us since we're boarding students."""
st_042090_0030#0,"""But but, thanks to that we get to have the room all to ourselves. Not a bad deal, I guess?"""

st_042090_0210#0,"""The Hitsugi I know rarely hesitates nor worries about anything! She's the kind of person who makes decisions on the go and never stops!"""
st_042090_0220#0,"""You never cared about what people say about you or the results of your efforts! Always surprising everyone with what you have!"""
