st_042115_0020#0,"""Oh, you just came at the right time."""
st_042115_0030#0,"""You... you're that pervert president! Yeah, Hagith Anie!"""
st_042115_0040#0,"""What a terrible way to remember a person!"""
st_042115_0050#0,"""H-Hitsugi..! I'm glad! I'm soo relieved!"""
st_042115_0060#0,"""I'm relieved, Hitsugi! Soo glad you came..! I believed in you!"""
st_042115_0070#0,"""K-Kohri, aren't you exaggerating a bit...? Wai- It can't be!-"""
st_042115_0080#0,"""I didn't do anything. Nothing at all. I'm a graduate of this place. I was also the Student Council President here 5 years ago."""
st_042115_0090#0,"""A former Student Council President... Then you must be a member of Mother Cluster too..."""
st_042115_0100#0,"""All Student Council members belong to Mother Cluster, right? Of course, I'm no exception."""
st_042115_0105#0,"""I was walking past and thought of stopping by to visit. It's been a while since I felt like an upperclassman here, but I suppose I went a bit too far."""
st_042115_0110#0,"""I wanted to ask some high school students about their thoughts on our apps, but that can wait until next time. Well... I'll see you around, Hitsugi Yasaka."""
st_042115_0120#0,"""Kohri, it's okay now, that pervert left already... Kohri? Are you really okay?"""
st_042115_0130#0,"""...Say, Hitsugi. Do you remember when \""Mother\""... invited you into Mother Cluster?"""
st_042115_0140#0,"""I still remember it to this day. It's something I'll never forget."""
st_042115_0150#0,"""Back then, I didn't have any friends. I was all alone... That's when \""Mother\"" started guiding me. Leading me to Mother Cluster."""
st_042115_0160#0,"""And then, I was able to meet you, Hitsugi.<br>\""Mother\"" made sure that I met you."""
st_042115_0170#0,"""To my lonely self, you're my very first friend. My first important person."""
st_042115_0180#0,"""Because I followed \""Mother's\"" words... It's thanks to \""Mother\"" that I'm able to meet and get along with you, Hitsugi... And then-also..!"""
st_042115_0190#0,"""Kohri..."""
st_042115_0200#0,"""...Hitsugi, you won't go anywhere right? Your place is here, Hitsugi."""
st_042115_0210#0,"""Everything will be okay if you listen to \""Mother\"". Everyone will be happy. So... don't go anywhere, okay?"""
st_042115_0220#0,"""...Listen to \""Mother\"", huh."""
st_042115_0230#0,"""The sense of trust in \""Mother\"" is amazing."""
st_042115_0240#0,"""...What is \""Mother\"" exactly? Is it really such an overwhelming presence?"""
st_042115_0250#0,"""At any rate, that was Hitsugi's older brother. The difference in height is almost like a parent and their child."""
