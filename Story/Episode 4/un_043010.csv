un_043010_0010#0,"""Yo, senpai. Oh, who is that with you?"""
un_043010_0020#0,"""Um, nice to meet you. My name is Hitsugi. This is Aru. Er...?"""
un_043010_0030#0,"""It's Io. No need for formalities. So, why are you guys with senpai?"""
un_043010_0040#0,"""Uhm, well... I owe a lot to<br><%me>, and..."""
un_043010_0050#0,"""Owe? Ah, I see. It's about that trouble that senpai got mixed up in."""
un_043010_0060#0,"""'That trouble'? It's already becoming a rumor. But I guess I can't deny it."""
un_043010_0070#0,"""You guys don't need to worry about anything. Senpai has always had a natural talent for getting into trouble."""
un_043010_0080#0,"""Isn't that right, senpai?"""
un_043010_0090#0,"""1. That isn't true"""
un_043010_0100#0,"""2. I've never thought of it as trouble"""
un_043010_0110#0,"""You just don't notice because you always pull through, but it worries everyone around you."""
un_043010_0120#0,"""That's right... That's just who senpai is."""
un_043010_0130#0,"""We're always saying to rely on us when you're in trouble, but you still try to sort everything out by yourself."""
un_043010_0140#0,"""Is it wrong to try and do everything yourself?"""
un_043010_0150#0,"""I'm not saying that it's wrong. I just don't want them to push themself too hard. And... I guess I want them to trust us more."""
un_043010_0160#0,"""Instead of trying to keep it all to yourself, swallow your pride and get help when you need it. That's what comrades are for.<br>...Isn't that right, senpai?"""
un_043010_0170#0,"""Well, no matter what we say, there's no changing senpai's mind."""
un_043010_0180#0,"""So we have to use this attitude to consider how to provide backup. Do you know what I mean?"""
un_043010_0190#0,"""Is <%me> always like that?"""
un_043010_0200#0,"""Indeed. They never change their mind once it's made up. Do you want to hear the story of when the [Profound Darkness] resurrected and they had to save Matoi?"""
