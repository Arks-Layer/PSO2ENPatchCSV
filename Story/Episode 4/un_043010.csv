un_043010_0010#0,"""Yo, senpai. Oh, who is that with you?"""
un_043010_0020#0,"""Um, nice to meet you. My name is Hitsugi<br>and this is Aru. And you are...?"""
un_043010_0030#0,"""The name is Io, no need for formalities. So, why are you guys with senpai?"""
un_043010_0040#0,"""Uhm, well... I'm in debt<br>to <%me> and..."""
un_043010_0050#0,"""In debt? Ah, I see. It's about that bothersome issue that senpai got mixed up in."""
un_043010_0060#0,"""Bothersome issue? It's already<br>becoming a rumor. I can't completely<br>deny it though."""
un_043010_0070#0,"""There's nothing you guys need to worry about. Senpai has always had an innate problem of embracing bothersome issues."""
un_043010_0080#0,"""Isn't that right, senpai?"""
un_043010_0090#0,"""1. That isn't true"""
un_043010_0100#0,"""2. I've never believed them to be bothersome"""
un_043010_0110#0,"""Well, you yourself probably don't realize it because it always gets solved in the end, but it means that everyone around you is worried."""
un_043010_0120#0,"""That's right... That's just who senpai is."""
un_043010_0130#0,"""We always say to rely on us more often when there's trouble, but you always try to solve everything yourself."""
un_043010_0140#0,"""Is it wrong to try to do everything yourself?"""
un_043010_0150#0,"""I'm not saying that that itself is wrong. I just<br>don't want them to push themselves too hard,<br>and I guess I want them to trust us more often."""
un_043010_0160#0,"""Instead of trying to keep it all to yourself, swallow your pride and get help when you<br>need it. That's why comrades exist.<br>Isn't that right, senpai?"""
un_043010_0170#0,"""Well, no matter how much we say, senpai's attitude won't change."""
un_043010_0180#0,"""That's why we need to also think of how to follow this attitude. I guess we're just used to this by now. How familiar are you with their history?"""
un_043010_0190#0,"""I'm guessing <%me><br>is always like that?"""
un_043010_0200#0,"""Indeed they are. Once they've decided on something, they will never change their stance. Do you want to hear the whole account of when the Profound Darkness resurfaced and they had to save Matoi?"""
