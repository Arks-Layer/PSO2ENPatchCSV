st_042120_0010#0,"""5 years ago... I lost both of my parents from an accident. When I was on the edge of despair, a kind, gentle voice reached me... That's, my meeting with \""Mother\""."""
st_042120_0020#0,"""It wasn't a direct meeting but, \""Mother's\"" voice over the Ether, it was gentle, very warm, and above all, it was always right."""
st_042120_0030#0,"""That's why I joined \""Mother Cluster\"". Believing in \""Mother's\"" words, acting for her. It's an organization for \""Mother\"" ."""

st_042120_0210#0,"""If it looks that way then, it seems like I've braced myself up a bit."""
