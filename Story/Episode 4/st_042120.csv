st_042120_0010#0,"""5 years ago... I lost both of my parents in an accident. When I was on the brink of despair, a kind, gentle voice reached me... That's how I met \""Mother\""."""
st_042120_0020#0,"""It wasn't a direct meeting, but \""Mother's\"" voice over the Ether. It was gentle, warm, and above all, it was always right."""
st_042120_0030#0,"""That's why I joined \""Mother Cluster\"". Believing in \""Mother's\"" words, acting for her. It's an organization for \""Mother\""."""
st_042120_0040#0,"""...But."""

st_042120_0060#0,"""Uwaah..! This is amazing... We came to another world...!"""
st_042120_0070#0,"""...Just by joining hands, he came here too. On top of that, our clothes stayed the same as the ones we were wearing on Earth."""
st_042120_0080#0,"""Aru also came here as he is... That means he's the same as me?- But \""Mother\"" didn't say anything like that."""

st_042120_0200#0,"""2. Are you forcing yourself?"""
st_042120_0210#0,"""If it looks that way, it's because I've braced myself a bit."""
st_042120_0220#0,"""To be honest, my head's still fuzzy. Everything I believed might be overturned... because I don't know anything."""

st_042120_0320#0,"""...I don't know. They just disappeared, I think."""
st_042120_0330#0,"""...Y-yup. I'm fine- I was just surprised. More importantly, Hitsugi and Aru...!"""
st_042120_0340#0,"""In that moment, during the direct contact, it felt like something was pulling back, forcing the link to disconnect... Fearing our contact with Aru."""
