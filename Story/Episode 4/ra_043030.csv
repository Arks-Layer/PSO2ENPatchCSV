ra_043030_0020#0,"""If we were to compare with ARKS, it is Earth's version of the Summoner ability."""
ra_043030_0030#0,"""Hitsugi, can you manifest your embodied sword for me?"""
ra_043030_0040#0,"""Umm, okay. \""Ame no Habakiri\""."""
ra_043030_0050#0,"""Is this alright?"""
ra_043030_0060#0,"""Yes, thank you very much."""
ra_043030_0070#0,"""Just now, under Hitsugi's commands, the photons in the atmosphere accumulated and took form."""
ra_043030_0080#0,"""As one of ARKS' abilities, we do embody photons, but it appears to be a bit different from how Earthlings do."""
ra_043030_0090#0,"""Something far greater than that... You embodied an image simply from thin air. It's something only someone can do if they're accustomed to ether."""
ra_043030_0100#0,"""Since imagery is directly linked to embodiment, it's likely to be more efficient as well."""
ra_043030_0110#0,"""It's flaws come from the lack of general usage, and the small number of people able to use it."""
ra_043030_0120#0,"""By the way, what was the name of your embodied weapon, Hitsugi? Ame no Hakiri? No, that's a bit off..."""
ra_043030_0130#0,"""Close. It's \""Ame no Habakiri\""."""
ra_043030_0140#0,"""Does it have an origin where it derived from?"""
ra_043030_0150#0,"""Yeah, umm..."""

ra_043030_0200#0,"""2. You like legends?"""
ra_043030_0210#0,"""I guess so. Particularly, I like flipping the pages of books. I don't know how to put it, but it calms me down."""
ra_043030_0220#0,"""Although I've read a lot of books, I definitely prefer legends and heroic fables."""
