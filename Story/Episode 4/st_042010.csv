st_042010_0010#0,"""Well done, <%me>!<br>We're still not quite sure what happened, but it's unlikely we'll see it again."""
st_042010_0020#0,"""Once again, I'll share the information I have about the planet we just transferred to."""
st_042010_0030#0,"""That star is located in a point of subspace that's not quite the same as ours."""
st_042010_0040#0,"""In layman's terms, it's a whole new world in a completely different dimension!"""
st_042010_0050#0,"""And different dimensions spells out convoluted travel. Needless to say, investigations are in order."""
st_042010_0060#0,"""So in short, that star exists within a different dimension, where other intelligent life exists."""
st_042010_0070#0,"""Shining like a pearl... This new world is called \""Earth.\"""""
st_042010_0080#0,"""By the way... When you visited Earth briefly, I'm sure you recall communicating with Hitsugi to be rather second nature."""
st_042010_0090#0,"""I've just finished gathering data on Earth's language."""
st_042010_0100#0,"""As soon as this debriefing is over, I'll try to pry some info out of the Intelligence Division's hands."""
st_042010_0110#0,"""...They're just kinda not giving it to us unless it becomes relevant. Commander Ulc was right... this is fishy. Stinky fishy!"""
st_042010_0120#0,"""We're even having trouble anchoring Earth's transfer co-ordinates as it is."""
st_042010_0130#0,"""All of that aside, we have more important matters to discuss!"""
st_042010_0140#0,"""After all, it's thanks to the efforts of <%me> and Hitsugi that we may begin to bridge the divide between Oracle and Earth!"""
st_042010_0150#0,"""Though, there's the question of how to send you there without proper co-ordinates... I'm not sure myself."""
st_042010_0160#0,"""It seems like your desire to save Hitsugi triggered a response with the Photons and helped transfer you over to Earth."""
st_042010_0170#0,"""Wow, I've really gone off topic. Well, you should be able to travel to Earth now. But we're still investigating, so keep our activities a secret."""
st_042010_0180#0,"""Optical Camouflage and Spatial Quarantine measures have been employed, so you should be able to operate without alerting Earthlings... Probably."""
st_042010_0190#0,"""...Since this technology's from the Intelligence Division, I'm still doubtful."""
st_042010_0200#0,"""The technology is said to be made possible by Transparent Blade Mai's latent abilities, but it all seems sketchy."""
st_042010_0210#0,"""Problems are popping up left and right and all around. We'll have to double our investigation efforts!"""
st_042010_0220#0,"""Oh! That's right, I forgot! I've got another important piece of information!"""
st_042010_0230#0,"""We have lost trace of the Dark Falz-like presence that appeared on Naberius."""
st_042010_0240#0,"""I've ordered a pursuit, but frankly speaking, odds are slim. I'm sorry."""
st_042010_0250#0,"""However! The silver lining is that, Hitsugi and <%me> were able to come into contact, forming a link!"""
st_042010_0260#0,"""1. Contact?"""
st_042010_0270#0,"""2. What is a link?"""
st_042010_0280#0,"""Don't you remember? When you tried to save Hitsugi, your hands came into contact."""
st_042010_0290#0,"""During that brief contact, some of your photons flowed into her and we are able to capture her signature."""
st_042010_0300#0,"""It's thanks to that that we were able to trace her in time to save her."""
st_042010_0310#0,"""It also allowed us to sniff around Earth to gather intel. Two birds with one stone!"""
st_042010_0320#0,"""With ARKS' advanced technology, it would be easy to look into her daily life! Hehehe... What scenes would you want to see?"""
st_042010_0330#0,"""1. Isn't that peeping?"""
st_042010_0340#0,"""2. In that case..."""
st_042010_0350#0,"""Not so! This information is strictly in the name of gathering information for Xiao-- I swear on my honor! It's perfectly fine!"""
st_042010_0360#0,"""Besides... Only us two will ever see it, so there's nothing to worry about."""
st_042010_0370#0,"""Well, the information we can get from doing this is inconsistent and fragmented. There's no telling if even Xiao could predict what we'll end up seeing."""
st_042010_0380#0,"""So close, yet so far... How disappointing!"""
st_042010_0390#0,"""All jokes aside, collecting information is paramount. There's abundant intelligent life there, after all!"""
st_042010_0400#0,"""We may accidentally peep into some private moments, but it's in the name of research. I'll do my best to sift through the info!"""
