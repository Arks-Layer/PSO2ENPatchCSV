st_042070_0010#0,"""Haaaah... Aru's soo cute! He's just like cotton candy!"""
st_042070_0020#0,"""You're still looking at the photos you took yesterday? Kohri, that obsession is dangerous."""
st_042070_0030#0,"""N-no way! Anyone would be like this when they look at cute things."""
st_042070_0040#0,"""Hitsugi, you're sharing a room with him and sleeping on the same bed right?"""
st_042070_0050#0,"""How nice... I wonder if something happened? I wonder who's the top and bottom? Ehehehe..."""
st_042070_0060#0,"""...You might just be the very reason Aru was brought over here."""
st_042070_0070#0,"""Even so, Hitsugi. How are you going to take care of Aru? Is it OK to bring an outsider into the dormitory?"""
st_042070_0080#0,"""Well... over spring break, I'll just tell them he's my younger brother."""
st_042070_0090#0,"""Ah, I get it. This dormitory allows family members to stay here as an exception."""
st_042070_0100#0,"""The problem is that we don't look alike. I guess I can always utilize Mother Cluster's authority if worst comes to worst."""
st_042070_0110#0,"""Ehehe, that's Mother for you."""
st_042070_0120#0,"""Aah... He's really cute! It's as if Hitsugi from PSO2 came to the real world just so we can make a Hitsugi-Kohri sandwich!"""
st_042070_0130#0,"""...Are you listening to yourself? Anyways, let's get back on track."""
st_042070_0140#0,"""Hey Kohri. You can drool over the picture later. Focus your obsessive compulsions on examining PSO2."""
st_042070_0150#0,"""I'm multitasking! The info we've got is probably one and the same though."""
st_042070_0160#0,"""The information particle \""Ether\"" was discovered 12 years ago in 2016. It's an element that allows high-speed communication without any delays or the need for a medium."""
st_042070_0170#0,"""With the particle as a base, the \""Ether Infrastructure\"" was constructed, launching global information technology into a new era. Now, Ether functions as a foundation for the world's operation."""
st_042070_0180#0,"""The people that discovered Ether developed the next generation Cloud-Based OS \""ESC-A\"". ESC-A Towers have been built across the world with the cooperation of many countries."""
st_042070_0190#0,"""As the number of ESC-A Towers rose, the whole world began to advance with the help of Ether and its OS, ESC-A."""
st_042070_0200#0,"""Through the Ether network, several mandated applications have been installed in all ESC-A machines, such as PSO2."""
st_042070_0210#0,"""It's an application to educate the youth about the convenience and reliability of Ether, that takes the form of a game."""
st_042070_0220#0,"""That covers all we've got so far."""
st_042070_0230#0,"""...But, Ether is still new tech. Mother mentioned that there are still plenty of bugs lurking within ESC-A."""
st_042070_0240#0,"""In order to bust the bugs, we, the chosen ones, were selected by Mother to enter Ether's Infrastructure, in other words PSO2, to carry out investigations."""
st_042070_0250#0,"""Entering the world of PSO2... That is a duty and privilege reserved only for those chosen by Mother Cluster."""
st_042070_0260#0,"""...And that covers the exposition. It's all confidential info hidden from civilians, though."""
st_042070_0270#0,"""...We're going in circles. Hasn't this happened to anyone before?"""
st_042070_0280#0,"""Ahaha... You're probably the first and only one to have dragged someone from the PSO2 world over here."""
st_042070_0290#0,"""But this proves that Mother Cluster is right about bugs floating around the Ether Infrastructure."""
st_042070_0300#0,"""Though, we still have no concrete evidence that this is all caused by a bug..."""
st_042070_0310#0,"""Oh, this news mentions PSO2's NPCs coming to life... Wait, it's just news about cosplayers."""
st_042070_0320#0,"""And this is news on the disappearing PSO2 players from a while back. This isn't it either..."""
st_042070_0330#0,"""Oh, yeah. Hitsugi, there's a way to solve all these mysteries. A really simple way."""
st_042070_0340#0,"""Yeah?"""
st_042070_0350#0,"""Let's consult Mother. Mother will definitely have more info."""
st_042070_0360#0,"""Yeah, that's right! Why didn't we think of this earlier?"""
st_042070_0370#0,"""One second, I'll contact them right away."""
st_042070_0380#0,"""W-wait!"""
st_042070_0390#0,"""...Hitsugi? What's wrong? Why did you stop me? If we asked Mother, we would've solved this."""
st_042070_0400#0,"""Mother asked us to investigate PSO2. So if anything happens, reporting to Mother takes precedence, don't you think?"""
st_042070_0410#0,"""Y-yeah... But hear me out, can you give me some time?"""
st_042070_0420#0,"""I want to give a proper report to Mother, on both Aru and PSO2. I want to investigate this thoroughly and report my findings."""
st_042070_0430#0,"""I'll file a report before the spring break is over. Let me do my thing for now."""
st_042070_0440#0,"""...Okay, I understand."""
st_042070_0450#0,"""I trust you, Hitsugi. If that's what you say, then it should be right."""
st_042070_0460#0,"""Although, if you're in a pinch, Hitsugi, go and talk to Mother. I'm sure Mother will help you."""
st_042070_0470#0,"""Of course."""
st_042070_0480#0,"""\""PSO2\"", a pre-installed game that comes with any standard ESC-A installation."""
st_042070_0490#0,"""The supposed AI in it move in a spontaneous manner completely unlike those of conventional AI."""
st_042070_0500#0,"""We, the chosen ones, are part of Mother Cluster, given the important duty of diving into the Ether to investigate this erraticism."""
st_042070_0510#0,"""That could've been a bug... If I leave it alone for too long, it might endanger \""ESC-A\""."""
st_042070_0520#0,"""...That, was what Mother told us."""
st_042070_0530#0,"""If I stay here, I won't know anything. I won't be able to see nor learn anything."""
st_042070_0540#0,"""...I'll have to go there again, won't I?"""
st_042070_0550#0,"""1. Xiera, are you a bug?"""
st_042070_0560#0,"""2. A world within a game?"""
st_042070_0570#0,"""That pretty much means that you are a bug too, <%me>!"""
st_042070_0580#0,"""On a more serious note, do you think that they will notice that they have in fact come to another world, and are not within this so-called game's infrastructure?"""
st_042070_0590#0,"""I've talked about this before, but it doesn't matter what world they think we're in."""
st_042070_0600#0,"""...What matters is that Hitsugi doesn't realize that she has come to another world."""
st_042070_0610#0,"""Anyone can tell at a glance. But... We'll have to keep her in the dark for now."""
st_042070_0620#0,"""This \""Mother\"" seems to play a vital role in this story."""
st_042070_0630#0,"""\""Mother\"" sounds like their equivalent of Xion."""
st_042070_0640#0,"""Wait, more importantly, didn't Hitsugi mention wanting to come over again? Wah, oh no, oh no. Gotta prepare."""
st_042070_0650#0,"""<%me>. Keep our observations a secret between just the two of us, okay?"""
