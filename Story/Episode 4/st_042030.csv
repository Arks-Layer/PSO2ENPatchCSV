st_042030_0010#0,"""Haah..."""
st_042030_0020#0,"""Now, now, Hitsugi! It's unbecoming for the most promising Student Council Presidential Candidate to heave sighs in the presence of the students."""
st_042030_0030#0,"""It's alright, I'm not the president yet!"""
st_042030_0040#0,"""And look who's talking, Miss Vice Presidential Candidate, Kohri Washinomiya."""
st_042030_0050#0,"""N-no, don't flatter me! I don't deserve it! I'm just a simple Student Council member!"""
st_042030_0060#0,"""Hey, Kohri.... Why don't you be the Council President instead?"""
st_042030_0070#0,"""I'm not used to that type of stuff. Besides, everybody here thinks that you're the better fit for the role!"""
st_042030_0080#0,"""They do, huh? Since we're all members of Mother Cluster, it just feels like another scramble to the top."""
st_042030_0090#0,"""Come on, Hitsugi! You don't have to say it like that."""
st_042030_0100#0,"""Competition is good, right? You're all the chosen members of Mother Cluster, after all."""
st_042030_0110#0,"""...Are you planning to reject the Council President position, Hitsugi?"""
st_042030_0120#0,"""I don't mind taking the position if you don't want it, Hitsugi. But I'll support you regardless."""
st_042030_0130#0,"""No, that's not it... ...*sigh*"""
st_042030_0140#0,"""By the way, I didn't see you in PSO2 yesterday. What were you doing?"""
st_042030_0150#0,"""\""PSO2\""..."""
st_042030_0160#0,"""Hitsugi?"""
st_042030_0170#0,"""Hey, Kohri... What do you think \""PSO2\"" is?"""
st_042030_0180#0,"""What do you mean by \""What it is\""?"""
st_042030_0190#0,"""Exactly what it sounds like. Just... tell me what you think about it, Kohri."""
st_042030_0200#0,"""O-kay? Let's see..."""
st_042030_0210#0,"""\""PSO2\"" is an online game whose popularity boomed through its compatibility with the ultra high-speed communication system known as \""Ether\""."""
st_042030_0220#0,"""And through \""Ether\"", the next-gen OS \""ESC-A\"" is born."""
st_042030_0230#0,"""PSO2 comes installed as standard on every system that runs ESC-A."""
st_042030_0240#0,"""I don't want the textbook explanation! I mean... what is it to us?"""
st_042030_0250#0,"""\""Us\""? ...Oh! You mean, as members of Mother Cluster. Right!"""
st_042030_0260#0,"""I see it as a game that we can play anytime, anywhere, with anyone through the Ether Infrastructure."""
st_042030_0270#0,"""Our job--as members of \""Mother Cluster\""-- is to maintain the ESC-A OS. You know, report and fix bugs and stuff."""
st_042030_0280#0,"""To achieve that, thousands upon thousands of recruits became members of this grand organization, handling the regular maintenance. Right?"""
st_042030_0290#0,"""Uh-huh! And with the integration of PSO2 in all of ESC-A's systems, there's naturally a lot of bugs to bust."""
st_042030_0300#0,"""It's really weird, though. The AI controlling the NPCs is acting really random."""
st_042030_0310#0,"""Anyway, our specific involvement with Mother Cluster is to gather information explicitly from PSO2."""
st_042030_0320#0,"""It's not like we're the only ones doing it, but if we don't work well, we'll easily fall behind the others."""
st_042030_0330#0,"""We know that PSO2 is just a game, so there's bound to be bugs..."""
st_042030_0340#0,"""...Hmm? I... think so? Well, Mother did call it \""a bug in ESC-A\"", after all."""
st_042030_0350#0,"""But the other day... Is that really what the game's supposed to be like? Were those people... really from the game?"""
st_042030_0360#0,"""Not to mention that monster... <%me>... and Aru..."""
st_042030_0370#0,"""...Hitsugi? Something wrong? Was it something I said? Sorry for killing the mood."""
st_042030_0380#0,"""...Kohri."""
st_042030_0390#0,""" W-what?"""
st_042030_0400#0,"""Kohri, I know that you hate boys, but can you be brave for a bit and come with me? There's someone I want you to meet."""
st_042030_0410#0,"""Oh, a... male? Is it your older brother?"""
st_042030_0420#0,"""Nope."""
st_042030_0430#0,"""It's not Enga? Wait...! Could that person be...? Oh no, it can't be...! Hitsugi!"""
st_042030_0440#0,"""Hitsugi, it's against the rules to have relationships! If the future Student Council President has someone like that, then their school life is over!"""
st_042030_0450#0,"""No, you idiot! Why would I introduce you to my boyfriend anyway?"""
st_042030_0460#0,"""So you DO have one?!"""
st_042030_0470#0,"""Of course not! Don't say it like that!"""
st_042030_0480#0,"""*siiigh*... The person I want you to meet isn't my older brother or boyfriend, okay?"""
st_042030_0490#0,"""Then who? Who is it?!"""
st_042030_0500#0,"""Who..."""
st_042030_0510#0,"""...My...little brother...?"""
st_042030_0520#0,"""...What?!"""
st_042030_0530#0,"""Umm... It seems like Hitsugi has quite an interesting friend."""
st_042030_0540#0,"""I'm not saying that it's strange or anything!"""
st_042030_0550#0,"""So, they have a communication system called<br>\""Ether\"" over there."""
st_042030_0553#0,"""There's an organization called \""Mother Cluster\""..."""
st_042030_0556#0,"""To them, our world is a bug in the system..."""
st_042030_0560#0,"""...The more we listen, the less we know. We are FAR from having enough information."""
