un_043040_0005#0,"""Hey, hello there! It's been a while since we've<br>met. It's Lisa, remember?"""
un_043040_0010#0,"""Strange to see you here. Are you here to shoot them too?"""
un_043040_0020#0,"""Isn't it strange that Lisa is here? Not just Lisa, but all the other ARKS are here too."""
un_043040_0030#0,"""Of course, only when we have received permission to battle here as ARKS."""
un_043040_0040#0,"""The Phantoms, was it? They appear here, they're fun to shoot at."""
un_043040_0050#0,"""It feels like shooting a Darker. They're not an organism, but rather something trying to take a physical shape."""
un_043040_0060#0,"""However, that mid-point where they're trying to take form just feels so fresh... Lisa can't get enough of it."""
un_043040_0070#0,"""Lisa envies you for being able to come here whenever you feel like it. Lisa wants to become a Guardian too."""
un_043040_0080#0,"""However, shooting and killing something while under restrictions is much more satisfying. Lisa doesn't mind at all. Eheheheheh."""
un_043040_0090#0,"""Well then, goodbye."""
