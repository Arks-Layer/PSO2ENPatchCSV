st_042050_0010#0,"""Waaa!!... This is irresistible!! Moreso than I could ever have imagined!"""
st_042050_0020#0,"""Aru! Face this way for me! Just like that! Now do a twirl!"""
st_042050_0030#0,"""...Big sis, I want to take these off... It's stuffy."""
st_042050_0040#0,"""No. Deal with it."""
st_042050_0050#0,"""I want to wear clothes like yours, Big sis!"""
st_042050_0060#0,"""You're a boy."""
st_042050_0070#0,"""A girly one at that!"""
st_042050_0080#0,"""Shut it, Kohri."""
st_042050_0090#0,"""Just keep it on. It really suits you anyway."""
st_042050_0100#0,"""Mmm... okay. Since you picked it out for me, I'll bear with it."""
st_042050_0110#0,"""Kohri picked these out, not me. ...Come to think of it, you're really good at picking out clothes."""
st_042050_0120#0,"""Oh, it's hardly praiseworthy! All I have to do is search on Ether. First you do this, then that... and voila!"""
st_042050_0130#0,"""Just type in the height, age and your budget, it'll automatically pick a match for you!"""
st_042050_0140#0,"""All of this is made possible with a YMT Corporation app called \""Trend Creation\"". Amazing, isn't it?"""
st_042050_0150#0,"""...Oh. Never knew we had this."""
st_042050_0160#0,"""Typical Hitsugi, you've never had any interest in fashion. I picked the clothes you're wearing with this, remember?"""
st_042050_0170#0,"""I'd choose a good book over fashion any day of the week if you ask me."""
st_042050_0180#0,"""Come on Hitsugi! Youth is all about food, games, and fashion! You need to live it while you're in it!"""
st_042050_0190#0,"""That would sound perfect if you leave fashion out of it."""
st_042050_0200#0,"""Hey, what's this?"""
st_042050_0210#0,"""This is an Ether Communication app. I used this to find the place to choose and buy your clothes."""
st_042050_0220#0,"""Check this out."""
st_042050_0230#0,"""Woah... That's amazing! I'm on that tiny screen!<br>...And I'm moving too!"""
st_042050_0240#0,"""But wait, there's more! After putting on the clothes, you can turn and view yourself 360 degrees. How convenient!"""
st_042050_0250#0,"""\""My Favorite Layout\""... What is this??"""
st_042050_0260#0,"""Oh, feast your eyes!"""
st_042050_0270#0,"""I'm wearing the same clothes as big sis... I want to wear this too!"""
st_042050_0280#0,"""Geez... This looks awfully similar to the character creation in PSO2, don't you think?"""
st_042050_0290#0,"""Y-yeah, I suppose you're right. Since PSO2 was integrated with the Ether network when it was created, maybe they used it as reference?"""
st_042050_0300#0,"""...Big sis, I'm hungry."""
st_042050_0310#0,"""Oh. Come to think of it, it's about lunchtime, huh? Great timing! Let's go find somewhere to grab a bite."""
st_042050_0320#0,"""Ahem! Leave it to moi! With my phone and my highly-evolved app, it shall be naught but a breezeful stroll!"""
st_042050_0330#0,"""Sounds like you're addicted. A smartphone addiction? Wait, make it Ether addiction."""
st_042050_0340#0,"""Nonono, it's not like that! I'm too cute to be addicted to anything!"""
st_042050_0350#0,"""I mean, people around the world are dependent upon Ether for so much these days. Labelling it an addiction is overdoing it."""
st_042050_0360#0,"""...You know, at this point, the world would be hard-pressed to survive without it."""
st_042050_0370#0,"""Mhmm... And bingo, I have found and reserved our lunch arrangements!"""
st_042050_0380#0,"""That world mainly manufactures low-end technology, but their communication technology is top-notch!"""
st_042050_0390#0,"""Their communication speed and infrastructure environments are comparable to ARKS very own!"""
st_042050_0400#0,"""Something feels fishy. It's like a forced evolution, almost as if it were a part of some greater scheme..."""
