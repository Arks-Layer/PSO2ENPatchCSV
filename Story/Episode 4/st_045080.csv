st_045080_0010#0,"""The ARKS ship has transported?! The ending coordinates are... wait, we're near the mothership! We were sent back to our universe?!"""
st_045080_0020#0,"""Ugh, the administrative controls are all messed up! Regardless, I need to respond to the inquiry from the mothership... What?"""
st_045080_0030#0,"""I... can't respond?! Communication to the other ships has been blocked?!"""
st_045080_0040#0,"""But the limiter on the ship is still active! We can't fight against the intruders with it on!"""

st_045080_0060#0,"""How were they able to do this?! To interrupt our technology so easily...?"""
st_045080_0070#0,"""I've been here countless times through PSO2, but this is my first time coming here directly... It's a strange feeling."""
st_045080_0080#0,"""It's all thanks to them coming to the moon. Once we had the coordinates, transportation was simple. This is going just as Mother wanted."""
st_045080_0090#0,"""Hmm... The materials used for construction... All the unique architecture... Everything here is distracting me."""
