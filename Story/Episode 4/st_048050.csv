st_048050_0020#0,"""What, my idiot sister? Why are you here?"""
st_048050_0030#0,"""Scoot over a bit."""
st_048050_0040#0,"""Hm... I just wanted to see how my older brother looks when he's depressed."""
st_048050_0050#0,"""Sorry to disappoint you. I'm not depressed. I felt like things were going to end up like this, someday."""
st_048050_0060#0,"""Did you suspect Ardem from the start?"""
st_048050_0070#0,"""He would just start saying weird things out of nowhere. He had a spirituality that didn't seem human."""
st_048050_0080#0,"""I guess that's why he made an organization called \""Earth Guide\"" and captivated so many people with it."""
st_048050_0090#0,"""You were captivated too?"""
st_048050_0100#0,"""I won't lie. In the end, I'm not different from you."""
st_048050_0110#0,"""The only difference was whether our foundation was Mother Cluster or Earth Guide."""
st_048050_0120#0,"""I was trying to act like an adult, but I was pushed to my limits, and had no choice but to rely on another person. That person being Ardem."""

st_048050_0140#0,"""...What's with that irritating gaze?"""
st_048050_0150#0,"""Well, I just thought it was odd you were being so sincere. It's not like you."""
st_048050_0160#0,"""Well, yeah. Unlike some people, I don't hold everything in and wait for it to explode."""
st_048050_0170#0,"""I know, Kohri really has some issues."""
st_048050_0180#0,"""I see you've become even more blissfully ignorant..."""
st_048050_0190#0,"""Just when we thought we were done with Mother, this happens. Earth is quite a reckless planet. I'm sure ARKS just see us as a nuisance."""
st_048050_0200#0,"""Even though ARKS was involved in the Mother situation, this is still really Earth's own problem. And yet, here we are, depending on them."""
st_048050_0210#0,"""...Big bro. You should depend on me too."""
st_048050_0220#0,"""Big bro even told me that I should depend on him... Because we're family, after all."""
st_048050_0230#0,"""That goes both ways. I'm part of big brother's family too... When you're in trouble, I am too, right?"""
st_048050_0240#0,"""I don't mean to do things without help, nor am I selfish. I'll depend on who I can, and do what I can do."""
