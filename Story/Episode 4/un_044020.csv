un_044020_0020#0,"""We're going to involve Senpai<br>in a conversation about Senpai...<br>You know no fear, Hitsugi."""
un_044020_0030#0,"""That said, you've wanted to<br>talk to <%me> too, right Io?<br>You have that look on your face."""
un_044020_0040#0,"""..."""
un_044020_0050#0,"""..More importantly, why<br>doesn't Hitsugi address<br>Senpai in a more respectful way?"""
un_044020_0060#0,"""Eh? Now that you've mentioned it...<br>I'm pretty sure I did back then,<br>Xiera included."""

un_044020_0080#0,"""We both agreed to not address each<br>other as such, however, maybe you<br>should add in more respect for<br>Senpai? Senpai did save your life, right?"""

un_044020_0120#0,"""It's too late for something that formal.<br>So it would feel weak. This is where we go with<br>something such as \""Sama\"" or \""King\""..."""

un_044020_0210#0,"""...Doesn't that sound embarrassing?"""
un_044020_0220#0,"""So? It's from the Medieval period, but I like it."""
