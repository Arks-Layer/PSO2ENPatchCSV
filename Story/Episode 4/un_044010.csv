un_044010_0010#0,"""It's okay, everyone is a beginner at the start! But when tomorrow comes, you'll be an experienced veteran! It'll all work out in the end!"""
un_044010_0020#0,"""So just this once... You can pretend you got tricked and try out Bouncer!"""
un_044010_0030#0,"""Uhm, even if you say that, I'm not really..."""
un_044010_0040#0,"""Come on! You know you want to! If you apply now, I'll include my easy-to-use Dual Blades! It's a wonderful deal!"""
un_044010_0050#0,"""Isn't this a weird way of recruiting people!? And besides, I'm not ARKS, so I probably wouldn't handle a class like that very well..."""
un_044010_0060#0,"""Ah! <%me>! A little help, please!"""
un_044010_0070#0,"""Oh, <%me>. This young lady is your friend, right?"""
un_044010_0080#0,"""That's even more of a reason to try being a Bouncer!"""
un_044010_0090#0,"""After all, this was a class created by <%me>!"""
un_044010_0100#0,"""Wait, really?! It is?!"""
un_044010_0110#0,"""No."""
un_044010_0120#0,"""Saga! You're supposed to back me up!"""
un_044010_0130#0,"""I'm not backing up a lie."""
un_044010_0140#0,"""Well... I may have been exaggerating when I say they \""created\"" it, but they were a big part of spreading it!"""
un_044010_0150#0,"""...Really?"""
un_044010_0160#0,"""Yes, yes, that's right!"""
un_044010_0170#0,"""1. It was Katori who spread Bouncer"""
un_044010_0180#0,"""2. It was Saga who spread Bouncer"""
un_044010_0190#0,"""3. You both spread Bouncer together"""
un_044010_0200#0,"""Wha... For you to say such a powerful thing to me... I'm so happy to be alive!"""
un_044010_0210#0,"""<%me>... Please don't tease Katori too much. She hasn't really grown up at all."""
un_044010_0220#0,"""Hey! It's rude to nod and agree with him!"""
un_044010_0230#0,"""Well surely-<br>...no, I'm useless, maybe because I'm short-<br>...maybe because I wasn't a good-..."""
un_044010_0240#0,"""...Honestly. Although I can't deny that fact, that statement is more of an exaggeration."""
un_044010_0250#0,"""Well, uh, definitely, but even so!"""
un_044010_0260#0,"""Saga's actually blushing from hearing you say that so boldly!"""
un_044010_0270#0,"""Ah. I feel the same as <%me>."""
un_044010_0280#0,"""Saga!?"""
un_044010_0290#0,"""The Bouncer class has been recognized by many in ARKS."""
un_044010_0300#0,"""Its spread has never been just the power of one person, but of many cooperating. Thanks to<br><%me>, and thanks to Katori's personality as well."""
un_044010_0310#0,"""Saga..."""
un_044010_0320#0,"""...Wait. My personality? Then I haven't really helped that much?"""
un_044010_0330#0,"""Big sis... What does that mean?"""
un_044010_0340#0,"""I think it means this lady lies about a lot."""
un_044010_0350#0,"""How mean!"""
un_044010_0360#0,"""Those two aren't ARKS, are they? As usual, you seem to be in the middle of troublesome matters."""
un_044010_0370#0,"""I won't try to stop you. Helping people is just who you are, like how Katori advertises bouncer however she can. No one would stop just cause I say so, right?"""
