st_041020_0020#0,"""I've never heard of a quest like this. The General Headquarters even asking me personally... Am I dreaming?"""
st_041020_0030#0,"""Could it be that they're watching me?"""
st_041020_0040#0,"""Of course, there's no way that's happening. There were bugs here since the start. This sort of behaviour is expected."""
st_041020_0050#0,"""AI getting suspicious of me and acting out of order. This has got to be a bug, yup."""
st_041020_0060#0,"""There's nothing to fear, Hitsugi. Yup, it's all totally normal!... Okay-- """

st_041020_0080#0,"""Umm... Would you be Hitsugi?"""
st_041020_0090#0,"""Yes but... I mean, of course!"""
st_041020_0100#0,"""I'm the ARKS Ship Administrator, a.k.a., the Operator, Xiera. Nice to meet you!"""

st_041020_0140#0,"""A lot happened, but I'll explain all that when you two return. This joint mission also serves as rehabilitation, you could say?"""
st_041020_0150#0,"""Haha... I see, \""rehabilitation\"", you say...?"""
st_041020_0160#0,"""THE Ship Operator assigns me alongside THE person who took down the [Profound Darkness]?! That CANNOT be a coincidence!"""
