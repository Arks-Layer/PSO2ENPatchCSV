un_049100_0020#0,"""That said, we've bumped into<br>each other a bunch in the city.<br>It's too late for a greeting."""
un_049100_0030#0,"""Today, just for you, we have<br>this special piece of intel."""
un_049100_0040#0,"""Surprise, surprise...<br>We've had made contact with a<br>suspicious ARKS before everyone else!"""
un_049100_0050#0,"""Though, not really a<br>suspicious ARKS anymore, since<br>we know they're from Earth."""
un_049100_0060#0,"""But, back then, when you were<br<in Cold Sleep. We had an<br>interaction with someone from Earth."""
un_049100_0070#0,"""To be honest, I was already<br>questioning of their nature<br>back then."""
un_049100_0080#0,"""No matter how many times we've<br>tried to talk to them, they've<br>just stood there, with a stupid<br>look on their faces."""
un_049100_0090#0,"""That just happened, because Patty<br>kept talking and talking. In-fact,<br>that happens with everyone."""
un_049100_0100#0,"""That's not true! This person here<br>listens to me very well! Right? Right?"""
un_049100_0110#0,"""1. Yes, of course..."""
un_049100_0120#0,"""2. Yeah..."""
un_049100_0130#0,"""See? Of course!"""
un_049100_0140#0,"""I don't know...<br>that sounded like half-hearted reply."""
un_049100_0150#0,"""Hey, \""Yeah!\"""""
un_049100_0160#0,"""...That was a long pause."""
un_049100_0170#0,"""It's totally worth being an<br>info dealer when you have<br>people that listen to you."""
un_049100_0180#0,"""Well, as you can see.<br>We're the same as always."""
un_049100_0190#0,"""So Patty, did you figure anything<br>out or have any leads on where we<br>should report, as a result from<br>interacting with that Earthling?"""
un_049100_0200#0,"""Eh? Uhhh, let me see...<br>Honestly, there weren't that many<br>differences between us. We can't<br>tell them apart either."""
un_049100_0210#0,"""Well, yeah... Patty is<br>likely not thinking this,<br>but that statement has a good point."""
un_049100_0220#0,"""An avatar that is a perfect copy.<br>That was apparently the conclusion<br>from ARKS' analysis."""
un_049100_0230#0,"""Which is why, recently, ARKS has<br>started a steady screening process.<br>In other words, a thorough search!"""
un_049100_0240#0,"""Even if they fall though the cracks,<br>they show undeniable odd traits when<br>dealt through directly."""
un_049100_0250#0,"""If you think of it this way...<br>maybe Patty's unrelenting interactions<br>aren't completely useless after all."""
un_049100_0260#0,"""Going through before anyone else,<br>and collecting intel! That is the<br>goal of an information dealer!"""
un_049100_0270#0,"""We look forward to working with you<br>again soon."""
