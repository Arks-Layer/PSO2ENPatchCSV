ra_033035_0210#0,"""Honestly, how did you even manage to remember the full details of such a boring tale?"""
ra_033035_0220#0,"""That's because it was you who recounted it to me, Sukuna-hime."""

ra_033035_0240#0,"""It's a boring tale, not one worth being recounted. None of this planet's history bears any merit. I suggest both of you forget it."""
ra_033035_0250#0,"""I'm sorry Kotoshiro... I think I made Sukuna-hime angry."""
ra_033035_0260#0,"""It's not your fault. Sukuna-hime's anger is always present, brought by the pointless conflict between the Shironians and Kuronites."""
