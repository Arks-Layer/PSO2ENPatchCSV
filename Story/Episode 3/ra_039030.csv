ra_039030_0020#0,"""It's very hard to believe, but you did see it happen."""
ra_039030_0030#0,"""Considering when so many things that were impossible become possible, anything these days isn't too farfetched."""
ra_039030_0040#0,"""Yucreta's usual link with this girl, isn't something we can do about."""
