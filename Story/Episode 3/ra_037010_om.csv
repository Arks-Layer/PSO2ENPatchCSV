ra_037010_0020#0,"""But even if we find her, there's nothing we can do."""
ra_037010_0030#0,"""Please... just take a rest. That's all you can do for now."""
ra_037010_0040#0,"""Ugh, it's so painful when you're too close to people..."""
al_030020_0010#0,"""...Um, well then. I do understand that we're just looking back over things that already happened, but it's hard to stay detached."""
al_030020_0020#0,"""This was especially painful to watch. She was the one person you most wanted to protect, and she ended up protecting you instead..."""
al_030020_0030#0,"""...I'm not innocent of that myself, am I. I wonder if I made Gi feel the same way you do now."""

al_030020_0080#0,"""[Double] is the most difficult Dark Falz to deal with, because its childishness makes it unpredictable."""
al_030020_0090#0,"""Right up until the end, its goal was to revive the [Profound Darkness]. By devouring you, it succeeded in that."""
al_030020_0100#0,"""It might not have been exactly as it had planned, but it succeeded regardless. It was pulling your strings the whole time."""
al_030020_0110#0,"""...And yet, the world still exists. The fact that you and I are here means there was still hope."""
al_030020_0120#0,"""What answers could be waiting for you?<br>Let's watch and see how it ends."""
