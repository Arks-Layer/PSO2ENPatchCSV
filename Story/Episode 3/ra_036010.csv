ra_036010_0010#0,"""Sorry for calling you out here<br><%me>."""
ra_036010_0020#0,"""I thought that we should talk for<br>a bit, after all that's happened.<br>Let's have a little chat."""
ra_036010_0030#0,"""So... After you got eaten by Double,<br>you met Luther inside, and he helped you escape."""
ra_036010_0040#0,"""That sounds truly unbelievable, but...<br>If you're standing right in front of me now, it must've been true."""
ra_036010_0050#0,"""I need to ask, <%me>.<br>How's your body holding up?"""
ra_036010_0060#0,"""1. Nothing wrong that I can see."""
ra_036010_0070#0,"""2. I'm feeling great."""
ra_036010_0080#0,"""Just as I suspected...<br>Matoi also said the same thing."""
ra_036010_0090#0,"""If anything, she was feeling great,<br>and couldn't feel any better."""
ra_036010_0100#0,"""Can you count how many Darkers,<br>and enemies corrupted by Darkers<br>that you've defeated so far?"""
ra_036010_0110#0,"""The answer is... <%skit_text><br>And that number isn't normal at all."""
ra_036010_0111#0,"""999999999"""
ra_036010_0120#0,"""You and Matoi...<br>You've been fighting too much."""
ra_036010_0130#0,"""You know why people other than ARKS shouldn't fight Darkers,<br>right?"""
ra_036010_0140#0,"""Because, even if you defeat one,<br>it leaves remnants behind.<br>Those will accumulate inside you and will<br>eventually corrupt you."""
ra_036010_0150#0,"""That's what happened to Naberius Natives, and the Dragonkin on Amduscia as well."""
ra_036010_0160#0,"""Harkotan has the Miko's protection,<br>which feeds from the corruption process.<br>Although, it doesn't seem to be foolproof."""
ra_036010_0170#0,"""But ARKS members can resist it.<br>The photon inside an ARKS body will neutralize the Darker particles."""
ra_036010_0180#0,"""However... There's a limit<br>to what they can do."""
ra_036010_0190#0,"""You've destroyed countless Darkers,<br>purified corrupted native lifeforms,<br>and driven off multiple Dark Falz<br>invasion attempts."""
ra_036010_0200#0,"""And then, you've been consumed by a Dark Falz, and escaped by manifesting enough power to get out... I can't even begin to calculate the effects of that."""
ra_036010_0210#0,"""Sorry...<br>This is beginning to sound awfully threatening right."""
ra_036010_0220#0,"""However, Philia and I agree on the opinion that you should go easy from now on."""
ra_036010_0230#0,"""If you're just fighting normally,<br>it shouldn't be a problem.<br>It's not like you're going to be<br>severely corrupted or anything."""
ra_036010_0240#0,"""Just don't forget,<br>You're not the only ARKS...<br>But you ARE the one."""
