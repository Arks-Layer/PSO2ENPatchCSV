ra_036010_0020#0,"""I thought that we should talk for a bit,<br>after all that's happened.<br>Let's have a little chat."""
ra_036010_0030#0,"""So... After you got eaten by Double,<br>you met Luther inside,<br>and he helped you escape."""
ra_036010_0040#0,"""That sounds truly unbelievable but...<br>If you're standing right in front of me now,<br>it must've been true."""

ra_036010_0060#0,"""1. Nothing wrong that I can see."""
ra_036010_0070#0,"""2. I'm feeling great."""
ra_036010_0080#0,"""Just as I suspected...<br>Matoi also said the same thing."""
ra_036010_0090#0,"""If anything, she was feeling great,<br>and couldn't feel any better."""

ra_036010_0130#0,"""You know why people other<br>than ARKS shouldn't fight Darkers,<br>right?"""
ra_036010_0140#0,"""Because, even if you defeat one,<br>it leaves remnants behind.<br>Those will accumulate inside you and will<br>eventually, corrupt you."""
ra_036010_0150#0,"""That's what happened to Naberius Natives,<br> and the Dragonkin on Amduscia as well."""
