st_033020_0010#0,"""Hey, Tama-hime-chan."""
st_033020_0020#0,"""Don't call me -chan. I am of the same existence as Sukuna-hime. Say my name properly without the suffix."""
st_033020_0030#0,"""Ah, uh, okay. Sorry, Tamahime-chan."""
st_033020_0040#0,"""...Oh, whatever. Anyways, Matoi wants to learn about [Magatsu], yes?"""
st_033020_0050#0,"""...Wow! You're very clever, Tama-hime-chan. As expected of Sukuna-hime's other body."""
st_033020_0060#0,"""...I know there's no ill will behind that, but the repetition makes me feel like I'm being made fun of."""
st_033020_0070#0,"""...Moving on, [Magatsu] is the calamity that destroys stars."""
st_033020_0080#0,"""It is a calamity born of sadness and lamentation. An existence that opposes life, a god that's a vessel of evil. It will annihilate both the Shironians and the Kuronites."""
st_033020_0090#0,"""I am here to prevent that. The Ashen Miko, Sukuna-hime that is."""
st_033020_0100#0,"""A star-destroying calamity. That, doesn't it sound like..."""
st_033020_0110#0,"""1. Like Dark Falz."""
st_033020_0120#0,"""2. Quite a troublesome god."""
st_033020_0130#0,"""...Right. It was sealed, just like how the Dark Falz was."""
st_033020_0140#0,"""That might be true but... doesn't that sound like a Dark Falz?"""
st_033020_0150#0,"""Are you referring to those black children when you say [Dark Falz]? Do not fret, [Magatsu] is a different kind of existence."""
st_033020_0160#0,"""...However, they may be essentially quite similar."""
st_033020_0170#0,"""Essentially?"""
st_033020_0180#0,"""Asides from differences in scale, it is a being born of sadness, sorrow, negative emotions in general, and is hostile to people."""
st_033020_0190#0,"""A being born from people that wants to destroy people... negative emotions are ignominious, aren't they."""
