ra_033010_0010#0,"""Ah, Mr. Kotoshiro."""
ra_033010_0020#0,"""<%me>. Matoi. Lady Sukuna-hime has awakened. This being the case, she wishes to have an audience with you..."""
ra_033010_0030#0,"""The word \""audience\"" carries a much too serious connotation. I simply wish to meet with them. I should like to do away with the formalities."""
ra_033010_0040#0,"""Kotoshiro, t'would do thee well to be more requiescent. Elsewise, no maiden should like to wed thee."""
ra_033010_0050#0,"""...Lady Sukuna-hime. Are you familiar with the phrase \""mind your own business\""?"""
ra_033010_0060#0,"""But of course. 'Tis a phrase oft employed by those whose nerves have been struck."""
ra_033010_0070#0,"""Um... Lady Sukuna-hime...?"""
ra_033010_0080#0,"""...Oh, prithee, do away with such formalities."""
ra_033010_0090#0,"""I am not thy Miko. I am but the Miko of Harkotan. You needn't refer to me by formal titles."""
ra_033010_0100#0,"""But... we shouldn't address a goddess with such disrespect..."""
ra_033010_0110#0,"""I am asking thee to refer to me without honorifics. What is disrespectful about that?"""
ra_033010_0120#0,"""Well, if thou art unwilling, shall I command thee by divine order? I should not like thee to force mine hand."""
ra_033010_0130#0,"""Alright, Sukuna-hime."""
ra_033010_0140#0,"""Understood, Lady Sukuna-hime."""
ra_033010_0150#0,"""Kaka! Very good."""
ra_033010_0160#0,"""Clearly thou understandeth not! ...Art thou taunting me? 'Tis in poor taste to taunt a goddess."""
ra_033010_0170#0,"""In any event, thou art quite meddlesome in thy ways."""
ra_033010_0180#0,"""Even supposing it was related to those unsightly beings accompanying the Kuronites, thou wert under no obligation to accompany this fool of mine."""
ra_033010_0190#0,"""Indeed, thou couldst have used this fool of mine as a decoy to strike thine enemy down. Thou didst not. Why?"""
ra_033010_0200#0,"""Perhaps... but it wouldn't feel right to just abandon him."""
ra_033010_0210#0,"""Is that all?"""
ra_033010_0220#0,"""I think so?"""
ra_033010_0230#0,"""...Kaka! Thou art quite amusing indeed. I feel honored to have met thee."""
ra_033010_0240#0,"""After an eternity of months and years, full glad am I to be able to finally call someone mine friends."""
ra_033010_0250#0,"""Friends? Oh, you don't have to say that!"""
ra_033010_0260#0,"""What? Is it not to thy liking? Is it improper for a goddess to make friends?"""
ra_033010_0270#0,"""Well, no, I didn't mean it like that..."""
ra_033010_0280#0,"""Then all is well. I already view ye both as mine friends. If the feeling isn't mutual, 'tis fine."""
ra_033010_0290#0,"""...Lady Sukuna-hime."""
ra_033010_0300#0,"""Honorifics."""
ra_033010_0310#0,"""Oh, um... Sukuna-hime. I'm glad to be your friend."""
