un_033020_0010#0,"""Ah, <%me>. What good timing."""
un_033020_0020#0,"""I was just speaking with Mr. Kotoshiro... I was just wondering how the Shironians can fight the Darkers and still be okay?"""
un_033020_0030#0,"""...You mentioned this earlier. I'm not entirely sure what exactly you mean. Are you suggesting we haven't the means to fight them?"""
un_033020_0040#0,"""I am. Without the power of Photons, you can't kill Darkers completely, so you run the risk of becoming infected by their remnants."""
un_033020_0050#0,"""Mr. Kotoshiro, you've likely seen for yourself how [Double] has been manipulating the Kuronites."""
un_033020_0060#0,"""...And despite our constant battles with them, we Shironians fail to exhibit any signs of infection..."""
un_033020_0070#0,"""I see... That is indeed mysterious."""
un_033020_0080#0,"""O foolish Kotoshiro! 'Tis far from mysterious. There exists aught to explain it."""
un_033020_0090#0,"""All inhabitants of this planet art under its divine protection. Of course such trifling malice would be purged."""
un_033020_0100#0,"""But Lady Sukuna-hime, that fails to explain the Kuronite's violent behaviour."""
un_033020_0110#0,"""Mm.... 'Tis true... The Kuronites should be protected by the selfsame divine protection..."""
un_033020_0120#0,"""Perhaps they art under some manner of deception wrought by those uncanny children?"""
un_033020_0130#0,"""'Tis passing likely they could have been decieved if those children had assumed the title of Miko themselves."""
un_033020_0140#0,"""Well, in any event, ye both needn't fuss over it. There's naught for it but for us to defend ourselves."""
un_033020_0150#0,"""T'will serve as a good lesson for the Kuronites, whose larger frames have led to their arrogance. May they be utterly routed."""
