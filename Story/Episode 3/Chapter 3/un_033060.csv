un_033060_0010#0,"""Ah, is that you? It is you, isn't it? Lisa's so glad to see you!"""
un_033060_0020#0,"""So glad that Lisa could've shot you!<br>...Okay, Lisa's just kidding."""
un_033060_0030#0,"""Oh by the way, have you been to one yet? One of those inexplicably corrupted places? Lisa won't let you say that you haven't been to one, you know?"""
un_033060_0040#0,"""To ARKS, they're classified as \""quarantined areas\"". You know, those!"""
un_033060_0050#0,"""Those are amazing. How mysterious! Lisa didn't think they would be so exciting."""
un_033060_0060#0,"""To be honest, those areas feel waaay more risky than that [Double] everyone's been talking about, you know?"""
un_033060_0070#0,"""Hm? What's so risky about them? Don't ask Lisa. Lisa just gets that feeling."""
un_033060_0080#0,"""Like, Planet Harkotan is in chaos because of [Double]'s invasion. That situation was, obviously, caused by [Double]."""
un_033060_0090#0,"""Then then then, what exactly caused those inexplicably corrupted areas?"""
un_033060_0100#0,"""Was it a Darker invasion? A natural disaster? Or was it something else entirely? Nobody knows what's what."""
un_033060_0110#0,"""...Although, perhaps there are people who have some sort of idea?"""
un_033060_0120#0,"""Well, as far as Lisa is concerned, those places are perfect for an all-you-can-shoot killing spree."""
un_033060_0130#0,"""Lisa doesn't really care about the how's, why's, and all the other small details like that."""
un_033060_0140#0,"""Lisa's happy as long as she has bad guys to shoot. Hehehe. Hehehehe!"""
