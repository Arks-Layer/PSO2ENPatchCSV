ra_039050_0010#0,"""Yo, Partner, you've come.<br>It's the usual, we're still being dragged."""
ra_039050_0020#0,"""But, it's not too bad."""
ra_039050_0030#0,"""Yuki-nee's just shy to talk about herself to others, especially with what she went through."""
ra_039050_0040#0,"""But I think it's therapeutic to talk to someone else other than me."""
ra_039050_0050#0,"""Well, that is of course, if they stop fighting long enough to talk..."""
ra_039050_0060#0,"""I haven't had the chance to go back to the ARKS Ship. How are things up there?"""
ra_039050_0070#0,"""I've heard from Io and Fourier that there's going to be changes to the management of the ship or something. Do they not need your assistance with this?"""
ra_039050_0080#0,"""I remember talking about the same thing, about changing the management system, back in our time."""
ra_039050_0090#0,"""Speaking from experience, don't bother. It's better to quit now, than eventually something happening in the future."""
ra_039050_0100#0,"""By the way. I somehow smell the scent of Xion."""
ra_039050_0110#0,"""How's Xion? Is she doing well?"""
ra_039050_0113#0,"""1. Xion no longer exists"""
ra_039050_0116#0,"""2. Xiao has taken her place"""
ra_039050_0120#0,"""Oh, Xion is no longer there? She's gone?"""
ra_039050_0130#0,"""There's a copy-like child?<br>But no Xion.<br>Is that so..."""
ra_039050_0140#0,"""Xiao? Who's that?<br>That means Xion's copy exists?<br>Where did Xion go?"""
ra_039050_0150#0,"""I see... Xion has passed away. I see..."""
ra_039050_0160#0,"""Even if the copy exists, it's still not Xion. Xion is gone..."""
ra_039050_0170#0,"""Oh, I remembered something. We have also tried to copy Xion."""
ra_039050_0180#0,"""And we failed, each time."""
ra_039050_0190#0,"""This was the story of the End of the Photoners."""
ra_039050_0200#0,"""Photoners were spread across the universe. In order to manage the vast universe of our civilization, we tried to make a copy of Xion."""
ra_039050_0210#0,"""The first was a success. However, we failed in that it couldn't be controlled at all, so we threw it away in subspace."""
ra_039050_0220#0,"""I don't know if it was subspace or another dimension entirely, but to treat it as if it were garbage... You cannot treat others as you so please."""
ra_039050_0230#0,"""That's right. And I think so too."""
ra_039050_0240#0,"""It was punishment, surely."""
ra_039050_0250#0,"""Failure after failure. We finally created another success, something that we were able to control."""
ra_039050_0260#0,"""The selfish desires we, Photoners, had at the time; Our desires and thoughts, influenced it..."""
ra_039050_0270#0,"""...And it became the [Profound Darkness]."""
ra_039050_0280#0,"""And so, because of that. The malicious desires of others, I suppose is part of human nature."""
ra_039050_0290#0,"""Why are you... How do you know that much? Were you apart of this?"""
ra_039050_0300#0,"""Apart of it? Hah, I can't say I was. I wasn't interested in that."""
ra_039050_0310#0,"""There was only one thing in my mind at the time. To polish my beauty."""
ra_039050_0320#0,"""I captured all the hearts in the universe. The most beautiful woman of all Photoners. Said to be the Goddess of Beauty herself."""
ra_039050_0330#0,"""Even military personnel and politicians. If you were a man, you were to watch yourself near me."""
ra_039050_0340#0,"""Even with their complaints, they still boasted their secrets to me at night."""
ra_039050_0350#0,"""Really, I've heard all sorts of things. Things I wanted to hear and things I did not. Sometimes I wished I could forget."""
