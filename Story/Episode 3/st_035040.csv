st_035040_0010#0,"""How is it? Fun, isn't it? This is [Double]'s inner universe. Where everything they eat is assembled, a truly chaotic space."""
st_035040_0020#0,"""You who have fought them, have seen their power. The power to copy their food."""
st_035040_0030#0,"""They breed those copies in this inner universe, and call them out to the real epoch."""
st_035040_0040#0,"""Perhaps it would best be called a parallel universe. Consume, modify, summon. Ahh, so interesting to study."""

st_035040_0140#0,"""Well, that doesn't really matter. Just... don't forget it."""
st_035040_0150#0,"""The fact is that if the ARKS weren't created, this world would already be under the control of the Darkers."""
