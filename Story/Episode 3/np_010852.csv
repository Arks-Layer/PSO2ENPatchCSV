11_voice_NPC_5085_104#0,"""The current situation? It's a long story so I'll summarize it for you."""
text01002#0,"""Void, the organization that did inhumane studies started 40 years ago."""
text01003#0,"""Luther was the leader of that organization. He took the knowledge and power from Xion and controlled both Oracle and ARKS behind the scenes."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_103#0,"""Luther said he wanted to understand Xion, but he just wanted her power."""
text01005#0,"""With <%me>'s cooperation, we managed to wrest control from Luther about half a year ago."""
text01006#0,"""ARKS managed to defeat Luther after he awakened as Dark Falz [Loser]."""
text01007#0,"""Oracle was released from the Photoners... No, from Luther's control."""
text01008#0,"""After the death of Xion, I took over her in managing the fleet."""
text01009#0,"""A lot of things happened since but I think that we are in a good spot for now."""
text01010#0,"""After all, Xion did her best for this outcome..."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_104#1,"""Matoi... She's been through difficult times."""
text02002#0,"""Previously, we travelled 10 years back to know more about Matoi's past and the reason behind her deleted records."""
text02003#0,"""Matoi... 2nd generation Claris Claes in a battle against Darkers 10 years ago, nearly turned into [Profound Darkness] due to the accumulated Darkness within her."""
text02004#0,"""In order to stop herself from turning, she attempted to take her own life."""
text02005#0,"""<%me> was present at that point, investigating the past. She was caught with you when I pulled you out of that situation."""
text02006#0,"""You then stumbled upon her 10 years after, having lost both her memories and power."""
text02007#0,"""If her loss was permanent, it wouldn't have made a difference. However, not only has she regained her powers, she managed to reunite with Clarissa."""
text02008#0,"""I have registered her as an ARKS member for now. However, that corruption from 10 years ago... I can't guarantee that it would not happen again."""
text02009#0,"""Right now, the data I have on hand is insufficient. But I just want you to know that it is possible."""
text02010#0,"""And if the need arises..."""
text02011#0,"""...Forget it."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_100#0,"""In any case, I would like you to stay close to Matoi. I am sure that she wants you around too."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_104#2,"""Dark Falz [Persona]. Truth be told, he remains a mystery to us."""
text03002#0,"""He does not control specific Darker types and he constantly interferes with <%me> and Matoi."""
text03003#0,"""As we have seen 10 years ago, [Persona] appeared in front of Matoi to deceive her."""
text03004#0,"""From appearance to perimeters, every detail was an exact match to yours. He was also able to travel across time."""
text03005#0,"""How is [Persona] capable of such a feat is still a mystery."""
text03006#0,"""It would be best to assume that [Persona] possesses exceptional qualities just like yourself."""
text03007#0,"""I do have a hypothesis but that requires further investigations. I'll contact you if there are further findings."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_104#3,"""After analysing the data from Wopal, we were able to understand more about the planet."""
text04002#0,"""Originally, Planet Wopal was a designed as a resort for Photoners."""
text04003#0,"""This is evident with ruins of an amusement park and shiny structures."""
text04004#0,"""However, something regarding the [Profound Darkness] caused the resort to be abandoned."""
text04005#0,"""As the Photoners travelled through the universe, Luther noticed the facility."""
text04006#0,"""The resort, even the planet, was repurposed to conduct his biological experiments."""
text04007#0,"""I guess this was what he was planning all along when he met Xion."""
text04008#0,"""According to the records, these experiments weren't very successful."""
text04009#0,"""Luther got bored of the experiments, abandoning Wopal and its facilities."""
text04010#0,"""The experimental subjects mutated into what we currently recognise as the Wopal natives."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_105#0,"""Luther was a real pain in the ass huh."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_104#4,"""Sara and Claris Claes. Well, I don't have to hide anything from you so I'll tell you everything I know."""
text05002#0,"""Sara was abducted by Luther 10 years ago due to the fact that she was tethered to Clarissa."""
text05003#0,"""Sara was used in multiple experiments again and again, producing data after data. That very same data that was later thrown out as garbage."""
text05004#0,"""As I observed the Oracle, I noticed the experiments. I decided not to act impulsively if I wanted to save her."""
text05005#0,"""I contacted Maria to rescue Sara and bring her to me."""
text05006#0,"""Come to think about it, that was the first time I contacted Maria."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_100#1,"""It was surprising that she believed a message that came from an unknown sender."""
text05008#0,"""But I digress, let's get back to the topic."""
text05009#0,"""Luther's experiments released the photons within Sara's body, thus permanently disabling her from using techniques again."""
text05010#0,"""In short, the photons in her body now is actually supplied by me."""
text05011#0,"""Thus, Sara and I are connected."""
text05012#0,"""Moving on, Claris Claes is a clone of Sara using Sara's data as reference."""
text05013#0,"""She was created to use an imitation of Clarissa, a weapon that pushes the power limits of techniques."""
text05014#0,"""She was the same age as Sara but he forced growth on her. Her actual age is actually 5-6 years old..."""
text05015#0,"""Well, what's done is done. There's nothing we can do about it."""
text05016#0,"""Both of them came to terms with their past and decided to continue living as Sara and Claris Claes."""
text05017#0,"""I will watch over them, placing my trust in their future."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_104#5,"""About the corrupted area that appeared in Naberius?"""
text06002#0,"""In any case, it is an abnormal corruption. However, the appearance of it is discomforting."""
text06003#0,"""Instead of saying that the place is corrupted, it feels more like a parallel universe."""
text06004#0,"""The reactions I am getting feels like an aberration of its natives."""
text06005#0,"""The cause or origin of this is unknown. There is no information left behind by Xion as well."""
text06006#0,"""This leaves us with no choice but to investigate it."""
text06007#0,"""Besides, there is a possibility that this might occur on other planets as well. I cannot simply sit back and watch it happen."""
text06008#0,"""Oh, and I've seen the records of you meeting [Persona] and analyzed it accordingly."""
text06009#0,"""He gave you a piece of advice, however it was too vague."""
text06010#0,"""In my opinion, we should not take his advice lightly."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_104#6,"""Sukuna-hime, the Ash Miko in Harkotan's legend."""
text07002#0,"""Although her title is a Miko, she's more like a god, the god of Harkotan."""
text07003#0,"""She doesn't seem keen to be treated as a god, perhaps she wants to be a treated as a normal person. I can understand how she feels..."""
text07004#0,"""In my case, I do not wish to return to being an observer floating in that pool of consciousness. I want to be the same as everyone here."""
text07005#0,"""Enough with the small talk... Sukuna-hime is a kind god as compared to Magatsu, which is a god of evil and annihilation. The god that harms the planet."""
text07006#0,"""Be it Shironians or Kuronites, it's destruction knows no bounds."""
text07007#0,"""Sukuna-hime has sealed Magatsu a long time ago but it seems that the seals' power are fading."""
text07008#0,"""While reinforcing the seal, [Double]'s interference caused a part of Magatsu to escape."""
text07009#0,"""I am more concerned about how [Double] is going to use Magatsu's power than simply the fact that a part of Magatsu escaped."""
text07010#0,"""This isn't simply a problem for Harkotan, but the universe as well."""
text07011#0,"""Magatsu is a threat to the universe that ARKS protects."""
text08001#0,"""The truth 10 years ago... Other than that event which we saw with our own eyes, there was another incident that happened."""
text08002#0,"""Well, that goes without saying. The world does not simply revolve around us."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_104#7,"""Alright, let me arrange the events in a timeline. Matoi fought with [Apprentice] and managed to defeat her."""
text08004#0,"""However, [Apprentice] survived that fight and tried to take Afin's sister, Yucreta as the new host."""
text08005#0,"""[Double] appeared and devoured [Apprentice] while she was in the midst taking over Yucreta."""
text08006#0,"""[Double] then retreated from the ARKS ship, not before abducting Yucreta."""
text08007#0,"""Yucreta was then manipulated by [Double] to do their bidding. She is not exactly a Dark Falz."""
text08008#0,"""Given that her she still retains her consciousness, she has potential to be an ARKS member."""
text08009#0,"""But she is also influenced by both [Double] and [Apprentice], which puts her in an awkward spot. """
text08010#0,"""That is why from now on, we need to observe her. This was also why I agreed to Afin's request."""
text08011#0,"""He would keep an eye on Yucreta on his own."""
text09001#0,"""<%me> and Matoi got captured within [Double]."""
text09002#0,"""Judging from the data, that is a seperate world. A seperate universe."""
text09003#0,"""A seperate universe in a seperate dimension from our universe...I should just call it a parallel universe."""
text09004#0,"""That being said, the universe within [Double] is significantly bigger than ours."""
text09005#0,"""There was something similar to that dimension in the research done by Photoners called subspace."""
text09006#0,"""It is not impossible to create one if you have the right knowledge and technology...Talking about this isn't going to change anything."""
text09007#0,"""[Double] uses that universe as a \""storeroom\"" of what they devoured, where copies are made and summoned into our universe at will."""
text09008#0,"""Copies of you and Matoi is possible since the both of you were in there before..."""
text09009#0,"""Let's not talk about it, it's great to see you both again."""
text09010#0,"""It may come at a price, but it's great that the both of you are safe."""
text10001#0,"""Matoi...absorbed all of the darkness within you and disappeared."""
text10002#0,"""Sara was present at that final moment, and I saw the records. At that point, there was nothing I could do."""
text10003#0,"""Her body was overflowing with darkness, more than a Dark Falz. That amount of darkness of [Profound Darkness]."""
text10004#0,"""I've mobilized ARKS to search for her whereabouts."""
text10005#0,"""And for that, I've disclosed information about Matoi to all of ARKS."""
text10006#0,"""You, and Matoi's special ability to absorb darkness."""
text10007#0,"""And the risk of that very ability, that incident 10 years ago."""
text10008#0,"""All information regarding [Profound Darkness] is now disclosed to the public."""
text10009#0,"""I should've done this from the start... I should've stopped the both of you."""
text10010#0,"""It was an oversight on my part, for thinking about others. I'll not make the same mistake twice..."""
text10011#0,"""ARKS will search for Matoi."""
text10012#0,"""I want you to rest after your health checkup. Please don't try anything reckless on your own."""
text10013#0,"""This is an order from the ARKS Administrator. I'll protect you."""
text10001#1,"""I guarantee you that all of ARKS is mobilized to find Matoi."""
text10002#1,"""I didn't order them to do so, everyone offered to help."""
text10003#1,"""……君が為してきたことに<br>無駄なことなんて何もなかったんだ。<br>今このときのために、今までがあった。"""
text10004#1,"""みんなの意志を一つにして<br>ただ一人を救うために力を尽くす。<br>……それが、今のアークスの姿なんだ。"""
text10005#1,"""ううん……違うか。<br>きっとこれが、人の姿なんだね。<br>……シオンにも見せてあげたかったな。"""
text10001#2,"""ぼくの演算の及ばない場所に<br>君とマトイは至ってしまったよ。"""
text10002#2,"""この結末は、予想できなかった。<br>全部が全部、ぼくの想定外さ。"""
text10003#2,"""でもね、きっとシオンにだって<br>この結末は演算できてなかったと<br>ぼくは思うよ。"""
text10004#2,"""ありえなかった未来を作り出す……<br>……それがきっと、シオンから君に<br>託された力の本質なんだろうね。"""
text10005#2,"""問題が全て解決されたわけじゃない。<br>ぼくたちにはまだやることが<br>たくさん残されている。"""
text10006#1,"""……けど今は、この新たな未来を<br>素直に喜んでいたいな。ははっ。"""
text10001#3,"""【深遠なる闇】は、依代となった<br>【仮面】によって、ナベリウスに<br>復活直前の状態で留められているんだ。"""
text10002#3,"""【深遠なる闇】が復活しようとし<br>君やアークスが戦い、力を削いだら<br>【仮面】の力によって復活前に戻る。"""
text10003#3,"""このサイクルを繰り返してるおかげで<br>復活は免れてはいるんだけど……<br>いつまで保たれるかはわからない。"""
text10004#3,"""だから今のうちに、この問題について<br>ぼくは徹底的に演算を行おうと思う。"""
text10005#3,"""答えが見つかる保証はないけれど<br>全てを救う方法を、探したいんだ。"""
text10001#4,"""ユクリータは【若人】ではなかった。<br>あくまで、その残滓を受けとったのみ。"""
text10002#4,"""しかし、そんなユクリータの内から<br>アウロラと名乗る女性が現れた。<br>彼女は自身を原初の【若人】と言う。"""
text10003#4,"""……なんとも、【若人】に関しては<br>イレギュラーなことが多すぎて<br>判断に困るよね。"""
text10004#4,"""でも、アウロラの言はあながち嘘でも<br>なさそうなんだ。"""
text10005#4,"""彼女の出現にあわせて、リリーパでの<br>ダーカーの活動が活発化している。"""
text10006#2,"""……いや、ダーカーの活動が活発になり<br>結果、ユクリータの中に残っていた<br>アウロラが目覚めた、というべきか。"""
text10007#1,"""リリーパにおけるダーカーの活発化は<br>おそらく【深遠なる闇】の影響だけど<br>……それだけではなさそうだ。"""
text10008#1,"""君自身のことはもちろん<br>アフィンやユクリータたちのことも<br>よろしく頼むよ。"""
