un_037120_0010#0,"""Yo, Partner... My sister, Yucreta, is over there."""
un_037120_0020#0,"""She's more or less coming to terms that I'm her younger brother, though she doesn't talk much."""
un_037120_0030#0,"""Though, it's better than before. She would run when I would appear."""
un_037120_0035#0,"""New clothes? Oh, both Yucreta and I had worn-out, damaged clothes from last time, so I got us new uniforms."""
un_037120_0040#0,"""So, how about you? Umm, with Matoi's..."""
un_037120_0050#0,"""I see... Don't give up just yet, Partner. I'll help with any way I possibly can."""
un_037120_0060#0,"""What an irresponsible way of talking... Are you implying that you shouldn't give up against the [Profound Darkness]?"""
un_037120_0070#0,"""Yuki-nee? Were you listening in?"""
un_037120_0080#0,"""Don't get me wrong... I'm just doing this so you'll leave me alone."""
un_037120_0090#0,"""So you're wondering if there's a way to undo what has happened to that girl, Matoi? Well unfortunately, I don't know."""
un_037120_0100#0,"""I'm likely the exception, I was half a Dark Falz. Normally it'd would be nearly impossible to undo that."""
un_037120_0110#0,"""No use on trying with pulling that on the [Profound Darkness]."""
un_037120_0120#0,"""Don't say that! Partner, don't give up on her..."""
un_037120_0130#0,"""If you really cared for her, don't you think the best way of saving her is to ease her suffering?"""
un_037120_0140#0,"""But you, you have that same \""not giving up\"" attitude as Afin does."""
un_037120_0150#0,"""I'm telling you that I was the exception, I was half-transformed."""
un_037120_0160#0,"""But if the same can be said for that girl, Matoi, then you might have a shot at it."""
un_037120_0170#0,"""I don't know how to undo it, so you're on your own there."""
un_037120_0180#0,"""Though, if I had to guess, you'll be copying what happened with me and call out her name."""
un_037120_0190#0,"""You'll find that to be surprisingly effective. Photons do convert emotions into power."""
un_037120_0200#0,"""Yuki-nee..."""
un_037120_0210#0,"""If that's all. Then you should be leaving."""
