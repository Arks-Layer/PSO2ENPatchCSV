un_036070_0010#0,"""... Thank you for creating my new Genesis. I hope it wasn't much trouble, Zieg."""
un_036070_0020#0,"""What are you talking about. Whenever you or Maria make a request, I already know the risks involved."""
un_036070_0030#0,"""Heh... That's for sure."""
un_036070_0040#0,"""It's been about 40 years since I last looked at your weapons. It brings me back..."""
un_036070_0050#0,"""40 years ago...<br>It's an unpleasant memory for me."""
un_036070_0060#0,"""Alma's... The original Claris Claes. You never forgot."""
un_036070_0070#0,"""The first sighting of White Tin Clarissa. The first ARKS in history. The strongest Technique user."""
un_036070_0080#0,"""That's all I know. I have never met her before. Only from stories."""
un_036070_0090#0,"""Her body was frail... I repeatedly asked her to lay low."""
un_036070_0100#0,"""Nevertheless, she was strong. So much to be able to seal [Elder]. So much to keep an eye on Luther."""
un_036070_0110#0,"""In exchange for safety and security of all ARKS, she sacrificed herself. There wasn't much time left..."""
un_036070_0120#0,"""I wanted to be her strength. So I became one of the three heroes, to support her."""
un_036070_0130#0,"""But I still regret... I did not concern myself enough... to stop and protect her."""
un_036070_0140#0,"""I couldn't even protect her. I was only able to discipline or obey."""
un_036070_0150#0,"""I could only defend the twisted order, born from her sacrifice."""
un_036070_0160#0,"""Regius...<br>That new Genesis I gave you.<br>Have I told you about the inscription?"""
un_036070_0170#0,"""Inscription?<br>Is it not \""World Ender\""?"""
un_036070_0180#0,"""You fool, why would I give my child, someone else's name? What kind of parent would do that?"""
un_036070_0190#0,"""Its inscription is \""World Creator.\"" The name is exactly what it means."""
un_036070_0200#0,"""\""World Creator.\""<br>That inscription is too heavy for me."""
un_036070_0210#0,"""But you must shoulder it. If you have destroyed the world once, you simply need to create it again."""
un_036070_0220#0,"""If you can go that far, strengthen your heart, and be proud of Alma. Then you can recreate the world."""
un_036070_0230#0,"""As a weaponsmith, that gives me sustenance in continuing working."""
un_036070_0240#0,"""Well said..."""
