un_036040_0010#0,"""Oh, I'm so glad you're safe! When I heard you'd disappeared, I was really worried..."""
un_036040_0020#0,"""Oh, by the way, it's Patty. Anyway, as I was saying..."""
un_036040_0030#0,"""I know you were worried, but that's a pretty poor greeting. Tea here."""
un_036040_0040#0,"""Anyway, I'm really glad you're back safely! Now we can get back to giving you information!"""
un_036040_0050#0,"""That's probably not something an information dealer should be saying.<br>...I guess I feel the same way, though."""
un_036040_0060#0,"""So, listen to what we've got for you today! We've got exclusive info on what [Double] is up to!"""
un_036040_0070#0,"""They weren't really doing anything before you came back."""
un_036040_0080#0,"""Their readings have been detected on Harkotan, but Darker levels there have been fairly low recently."""
un_036040_0090#0,"""Considering how active they were before, it's kind of creepy...<br>What could they be planning?"""
un_036040_0100#0,"""Hey, here's a thought...<br>Maybe they're not planning anything at all!"""
un_036040_0110#0,"""Woah! That glare nearly stopped my heart! But seriously, think about it!"""
un_036040_0120#0,"""The Darker attacks on Harkotan are low-level at best, and there's no sign of a big push coming!"""
un_036040_0130#0,"""Kinda looks like they just can't be bothered to do anything, doesn't it?"""
un_036040_0140#0,"""Hm, maybe..."""
un_036040_0150#0,"""Anyway, enough about [Double], let's talk about me!"""
un_036040_0160#0,"""You want to talk about you, do you? Hmm..."""
un_036040_0170#0,"""Your information gathering on the ARKS ship is low-level at best, and there's no sign of us making any progress in our investigations..."""
un_036040_0180#0,"""You're the one who can't be bothered to do anything, idiot!"""
un_036040_0190#0,"""Where's this coming from?!"""
