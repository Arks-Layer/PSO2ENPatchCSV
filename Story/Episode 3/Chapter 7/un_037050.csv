un_037050_0010#0,"""Are you nervous, <%me>? It'd be understandable if you were."""
un_037050_0020#0,"""All forms of prosperity come with a dark side. Prosperity that encompasses the whole universe comes with a truly immeasurable dark side."""
un_037050_0030#0,"""Exactly how many Photons are required in order to cleanse all of that darkness? Lisa couldn't even imagine."""
un_037050_0040#0,"""If you asked her whether or not she believes there's a way to win, she'd probably say there isn't."""
