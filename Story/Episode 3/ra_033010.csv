ra_033010_0020#0,"""<%me>. Matoi. Lady Sukuna-hime has awakened, and she wishes to have an audience with the both of you."""
ra_033010_0030#0,"""Audience, you say? Isn't that too heavy a word to use? One merely wishes to meet them, there is no need to be so fretful."""
ra_033010_0040#0,"""Kotoshiro, cease that posture. Unlax one's body and be at ease. One shall never be wed by being this austere."""

ra_033010_0060#0,"""Of course, one is well aware. Striking where it hurts, is it not efficient?"""
