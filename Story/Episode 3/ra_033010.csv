ra_033010_0010#0,"""Ah, Mister Kotoshiro."""
ra_033010_0020#0,"""<%me>. Matoi. Lady Sukuna-hime has awakened, and she wishes to have an audience with the both of you."""
ra_033010_0030#0,"""Audience, you say? Isn't that too heavy a word to use? One merely wishes to meet them, there is no need to be so fretful."""
ra_033010_0040#0,"""Kotoshiro, cease that posture. Relax thy body and be at ease. Thou shalt never be wed if thou art so austere."""
ra_033010_0050#0,"""Milady. Please refrain from speaking unnecessary words."""
ra_033010_0060#0,"""Of course, one is well aware. Striking where it hurts, is it not efficient?"""
ra_033010_0070#0,"""Erm... Lady Sukuna-hime?"""
ra_033010_0080#0,"""What have we? Do not be so reserved in one's presence."""

ra_033010_0150#0,"""Kaka! That will do."""
ra_033010_0160#0,"""Dost thou not understand? Thou art... teasing me? That is a tasteless pastime, to tease a Deity."""
ra_033010_0170#0,"""Be that as it may, thou art quite meddlesome."""
ra_033010_0180#0,"""Though thou may have ties with the troublesome dark ones colluding with the Kuronites, there should not be a need to be with this fool."""
