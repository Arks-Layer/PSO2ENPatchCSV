un_032110_0010#0,"""Oh, <%me>. Fancy meeting you here."""
un_032110_0020#0,"""I'm uh, on a personal search for information. I thought it might be here..."""
un_032110_0030#0,"""...Hate to break it to you, but I don't think the information you're looking for is here, Theodore."""
un_032110_0040#0,"""M-Maria? How do you know what I'm looking for?"""
un_032110_0050#0,"""I can see it in your eyes. You're searching for a way to return to being a Newman."""
un_032110_0060#0,"""But what's wrong with being a Dewman? You won't die from it, and you're far stronger than before."""
un_032110_0070#0,"""...Sometimes, I see this very sad look in Ulc's eyes."""
un_032110_0080#0,"""I never saw that when I was still a Newman."""
un_032110_0090#0,"""Ulc, huh? But she didn't so much as bat an eye when she learned of ARKS' dark secrets..."""
un_032110_0100#0,"""And besides, I'm different... I acquired this, like a disease."""
un_032110_0110#0,"""So... I'm not surprised that people think I'm creepy."""
un_032110_0120#0,"""...Ah, I get it. That girl knows Mr Pessimistic here inside-out..."""
un_032110_0130#0,"""Listen, kiddo. Do you know why CASTS were made?"""
un_032110_0140#0,"""Uh... well... it's a way to extend the life of someone born with a frail body."""
un_032110_0150#0,"""Heh... are you stupid? The Photoners didn't go out of their way to create a race for that."""
un_032110_0160#0,"""Sure, the technology can be used to save lives, but... only if they have the affinity."""
un_032110_0170#0,"""CAST tech is reserved for people whose bodies cannot withstand their innate Photon affinity."""
un_032110_0180#0,"""I'm sure you know, like everyone, that ARKS is knee deep in genetic manipulation."""
un_032110_0190#0,"""Sometimes, or I should say more often than not, we see kids born with tremendous ability."""
un_032110_0200#0,"""That ability unfortunately proves too much for their bodies to handle."""
un_032110_0210#0,"""Once it's certain their bodies won't last, they are transferred to a mechanical one, to make the best use of it."""
un_032110_0220#0,"""There is in fact a decay in ability because of the procedure, but it's still plenty to utilize on the front lines."""
un_032110_0230#0,"""And that's where CASTs came from. Get the point?"""
un_032110_0240#0,"""Time for question number two: Theodore, do you think CASTs are creepy?"""
un_032110_0250#0,"""...No, not at all."""
un_032110_0260#0,"""And you're just like us. So what's the problem?"""
un_032110_0270#0,"""That girl knew you'd be hung up on this, and has been worried about you the whole time."""
un_032110_0280#0,"""If you've got the time to waste on this, then better to spend it by her side."""
un_032110_0290#0,"""It doesn't matter how strong, or how talented... it matters what kind of person you are."""
un_032110_0300#0,"""Is that clear? If so, then get your ass back on deck!"""
un_032110_0310#0,"""Could that wishy-washy kid be any more clueless about a girl's heart? Makes me want to lecture him every time."""
un_032110_0320#0,"""Well, he's still leagues ahead of the the strongest blockhead in the universe."""
un_032110_0330#0,"""Who? Haha...I'll let you figure that out yourself."""
