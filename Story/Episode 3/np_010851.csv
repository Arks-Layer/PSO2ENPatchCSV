11_voice_NPC_5085_104#0,"""About ARKS... Let's start from the beginning of Arks."""
text01002#0,"""The name \""ARKS\"" was given to the team that investigates the various planets in the Universe."""
text01003#0,"""The purpose of ARKS is not simply conducting investigations. They are also responsible for annihilating Darkers, or any enemies corrupted by Darkers."""
text01004#0,"""ARKS was first created by a civilization known as the Photoners."""
text01005#0,"""No... ARKS was created by a being revered as a god by Photoners known as \""Xion\""."""
text01006#0,"""Her intention was to protect the universe and exterminate Darkers."""
text01007#0,"""Over the years... ARKS lost sight of its purpose, but I managed to put it back on track."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_100#0,"""Exploring the universe, investigate planets. Upon encountering Darkers, fight and defeat them."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_106#0,"""About Oracle, huh? Oracle is basically an enormous fleet of ships."""
text02002#0,"""Each ARKS Ship serves as a base of operations for ARKS and also as the residence for its citizens."""
text02003#0,"""The fleet is made up of such ships."""
text02004#0,"""Currently, we are in just one of the many ships, and this is just a section."""
text02005#0,"""And the ship at the heart of the fleet, the \""Mothership\"", houses the core of my existence."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_108#0,"""Previously, Xion was the core of the Mothership. But we lost her to [Loser]."""
text02007#0,"""Since then, I have succeeded Xion, assuming control of the whole fleet."""
text02008#0,"""To put it simply, Oracle is now under my control."""
text02009#0,"""Though it does get lonely without Xion... I have to push on."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_100#1,"""For the future of Oracle. For ARKS. For you and me."""
text03001#0,"""About Darkers... They spread throughout the universe. An enemy of the universe, an enemy of all life."""
text03002#0,"""Darkers consume all in their path. Every civilization, every living thing."""
text03003#0,"""Only ARKS can permanently defeat Darkers with the use of Photons."""
text03004#0,"""Even if someone is able to defeat the Darkers without the use of Photons, the residual darkness will eventually corrupt them."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_105#0,"""Under the Darkers corruption, they lose any consciousness of themselves, mutating into a ferocious enemy."""
text03006#0,"""This is not only limited to organic beings. Mechanical beings and artificial intelligence are equally susceptible. """
text03007#0,"""There are variances in mutation, however they end up corrupted all the same. Therefore, only ARKS is able to defeat Darkers."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_104#1,"""Other means of defeating them may exist, if you consider the endless possibilities of the universe..."""
text03009#0,"""But as of now, only ARKS is able to exterminate the Darkers. That is why we are travelling across the universe."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_104#2,"""Dark Falz... To be honest, I do not have much information about them... So this will be short."""
text04002#0,"""Currently, there is 5 confirmed Dark Falz. [Elder], [Apprentice], [Loser], [Double] and lastly, [Persona]."""
text04003#0,"""I can't say much about their characteristics... Well, you can simply think of them as the Commanders of Darkers."""
text04004#0,"""[Elder] and [Apprentice] are more active than others in attacking ARKS."""
text04005#0,"""[Loser] was defeated by Regius, but was devoured by [Double], and so clones of it appear frequently."""
text04006#0,"""As for [Persona]... Honestly, I don't know much."""
text04007#0,"""Unless we are able to gather more information, there's nothing more that I can share. Sorry."""
text04008#0,"""One thing's for sure, however, and that is we will not have peace until the Dark Falz is defeated."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_100#2,"""It's tough. That's why ARKS has to do it, only ARKS can do it."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_100#3,"""The Matter Board... I can tell you what I understand about it."""
text05002#0,"""As Xion was capable of calculating every possibility in this universe, she was able to calculate her desired outcome."""
text05003#0,"""<%me>. The Matter Board was created to allow you to change the future."""
text05004#0,"""Besides making it possible to change the future, you could travel back in time to correct the past."""
text05005#0,"""The Matter Board allowed you to save people that you could not save before, or chance upon encounters that were not supposed to happen."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_108#1,"""However, with Xion gone, I am unable to create a perfect Matter Board."""
text05007#0,"""My Matter Boards are simply an weaker imitation of Xion's."""
text05008#0,"""Although it is still capable of time travel and changing the future to a certain degree... Making any significant change to the past is simply out of the question."""
text05009#0,"""The Matter Board is the product of Xion's wishes. I have yet to fully grasp it."""
text05010#0,"""However, I am able to understand and use Matter Boards left behind by Xion."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_100#4,"""For now... I should make it easier for everyone to understand and use it huh?"""
