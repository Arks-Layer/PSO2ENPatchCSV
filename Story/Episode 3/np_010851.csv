11_voice_NPC_5085_104#0,"""About ARKS... Let's start from the Beginning of Arks."""
text01002#0,"""The name \""ARKS\"" was given to the team that investigates the various planets in the Universe."""
text01003#0,"""The purpose of ARKS is not simply conducting investigations. They are also responsible for annihilating Darkers or any enemies corrupted by Darkers."""
text01004#0,"""ARKS was first created by a Civilization known as the Photoners."""
text01005#0,"""No... ARKS was created by a Being revered as a God by Photoners known as \""Xion\"". """
text01006#0,"""All for the purpose of defeating Darkers, and act as the Guardians of the Universe"""
text01007#0,"""Over the years, the objectives of ARKS seemed to have veered off course. Somehow, I managed to guide it back. """
11_voice_NPC_5085_100#0,"""Exploring the Universe, Investigate Planets. Encountering any Darkers, fight and defeat them. That is ARKS."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_106#0,"""About the Oracle huh? Oracle is basically an enormous fleet of Ships."""
text02002#0,"""Each ARKS Ship serves as a base of operations for ARKS and also as the residence for its citizens."""
text02003#0,"""The fleet is made up of such ships."""
text02004#0,"""Currently, we are in just one of the many Ships. Just a section of this Ship. """
text02005#0,"""And the ship at the heart of the fleet, the \""Mothership\"", houses the core of my existence."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_108#0,"""Previously, Xion was the core of the Mothership. However, we lost her to [Loser]. """
text02007#0,"""Since then, I have succeeded Xion, assuming control of the whole fleet."""
text02008#0,"""That sounds confusing huh.. To put it simply, Oracle is under my control."""
text02009#0,"""Though it might get lonely without Xion... I have to push on."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_100#1,"""For the future of Oracle. For ARKS. For you and me."""
text03001#0,"""About Darkers... They spread throughout the Universe. An enemy of the Universe, an enemy of every living being."""
text03002#0,"""Darkers consume all in their path. Every civilization, every living thing."""
text03003#0,"""Only ARKS can permanently defeat Darkers with the use of Photons."""
text03004#0,"""Even if someone is able to defeat the Darkers without the use of Photons, the residual fragments will eventually corrupt him. """
11_voice_NPC_5085_105#0,"""Under the Darkers corruption, they lose any consciousness of themselves, mutating into a ferocious enemy."""
text03006#0,"""This is not only limited to organic beings. Mechanical beings and Artificial Intelligence are equally susceptible. """
text03007#0,"""There are variances in mutation, however they end up corrupted all the same. Therefore, only ARKS is able to defeat Darkers."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_104#1,"""Other means of defeating them may exist, if you consider the endless possibilities of the Universe."""
text03009#0,"""For now, only ARKS is able to exterminate the Darkers. Which is why we are travelling across the Universe."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_104#2,"""Dark Falz... To be honest, I do not have much information regarding them... So this will be short."""
text04002#0,"""Currently, there is 5 confirmed existence of Dark Falz. [Elder], [Apprentice], [Loser], [Double] and lastly, [Persona]"""
text04003#0,"""I can't say much about their characteristics... Well, you can simply think of them as the Commanders of Darkers."""
text04004#0,"""[Elder] and [Apprentice] is more active than others in attacking ARKS."""
text04005#0,"""[Loser] was defeated by Regius.. Due to [Double]'s power however, clones of [Loser] appear frequently."""
text04006#0,"""As for [Persona]... Honestly, I dont know much."""
text04007#0,"""Unless we are able to gather more information, there's nothing I can share. Sorry."""
text04008#0,"""One thing is for sure, we will not have peace until Dark Falz is defeated."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_100#2,"""It's tough. That's why ARKS has to do it, only ARKS can do it."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_100#3,"""Matter Board... I can tell you what I understand about it."""
text05002#0,"""As Xion was capable of calculating every possiblity in this Universe. She was able to calculate her desired outcome."""
text05003#0,"""<%me>.<br>Matter Board was created for you to change the future."""
text05004#0,"""Besides making it possible to change the future, you could travel back in time to correct the past."""
text05005#0,"""Matter Board allowed you to save people that you could not save before, or chancing upon encounters that were not supposed to happen"""
11_voice_NPC_5085_108#1,"""However, with Xion gone. I am unable to create a perfect Matter Board"""
text05007#0,"""My Matter Boards are simply an imitation of Xion's, weaker than Xion's."""
text05008#0,"""Although it is still capable of time travel and changing the future to a certain degree... Making significant changes to the past is simply out of the question."""
text05009#0,"""Because the Matter Board is the product of Xion's wishes, I am unable to fully grasp it."""
text05010#0,"""However, I am able to understand and use Matter Boards left behind by Xion."""
11_voice_NPC_5085_100#4,"""For now... Only I am able understand it. I should arrange it for people to understand it easier huh?"""
