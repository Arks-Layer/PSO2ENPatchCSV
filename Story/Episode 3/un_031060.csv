un_031060_0020#0,"""Well hello, my dear! Impeccable timing! Step this way!"""
un_031060_0030#0,"""Katori. Your training is far from over."""
un_031060_0040#0,"""Now, now Sir Saga! This is hardly the time or place!"""
un_031060_0050#0,"""<%me> here was just asking to learn more about your Jet Boots!!"""
un_031060_0060#0,"""...at this very moment? How terribly convenient..."""
un_031060_0070#0,"""...very well. To turn down such a request is against our duty. Allow me to explain."""
un_031060_0080#0,"""Jet Boots are unique leg-based weapons."""
un_031060_0090#0,"""Its primary characteristic is that as Techniques are charged, it both changes element and boosts damage."""
un_031060_0100#0,"""...in short, Jet Boots are in fact Tech weapons. They rely on Techniques to function."""
un_031060_0110#0,"""Thus, one would expect these to be better suited for a Newman like Katori instead of a Cast such as myself. However..."""
un_031060_0120#0,"""It's one thing to have to wear such revealing attire, but then to brandish my legs in such a manner, how disgraceful! Eep!"""
un_031060_0130#0,"""...Katori's immaturity knows no bounds, and so I am forced to assume the role."""
un_031060_0140#0,"""Why thank you for your honest opinion!!"""
un_031060_0150#0,"""I suppose that's sufficient explanation. I fulfilled my duty. Katori, back to training."""
un_031060_0160#0,"""Huh!? O-oh! I feel faint!"""
un_031060_0170#0,"""Is that so? Not to worry, a bit of exercise will improve your condition."""
un_031060_0180#0,"""Have you not a shred of sympathy!?"""
