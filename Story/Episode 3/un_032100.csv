un_032100_0010#0,"""How is it, Zieg? Do you see anything wrong?"""
un_032100_0020#0,"""Erm... I see no obvious malfunction. The restoration was perfect."""
un_032100_0030#0,"""But... it's not the same. Using it in battle, it doesn't feel the same."""
un_032100_0040#0,"""...I know what yer tryin' to say. Clarissa's boundless power is gone."""
un_032100_0050#0,"""After reassemblin' her, I sensed a dormant power. Now? ...gone."""
un_032100_0060#0,"""I dunno the exact way to say it, but one thing's for sure - she's weaker than before."""
un_032100_0070#0,"""Aww... I wonder why?"""
un_032100_0080#0,"""If I had to venture to guess... it's because Xion is no more."""
un_032100_0090#0,"""The Genesis Weapons owed their extraordinary performance to the power they received from the Mothership."""
un_032100_0100#0,"""Now that the Mothership's... I mean, Xion's... power is gone, they are now a shadow of what they used to be."""
un_032100_0110#0,"""...hmph, you got that right. Even 'ol Zieg here could craft one o' this level."""
un_032100_0120#0,"""The World Ender couldn't even hold up after one use without the Mothership's power."""
un_032100_0130#0,"""It goes to show just how vital her power was to the Genesis Weapons."""
un_032100_0140#0,"""But even among the Genesis Weapons, Clarissa is an exception. Her origin is different."""
un_032100_0150#0,"""It's a miracle alone that it still maintains its form. I doubt its power will ever be the same."""
un_032100_0160#0,"""...So, Clarissa is kind of a memento of Xion, then?"""
un_032100_0170#0,"""...You could say so."""
un_032100_0180#0,"""...Regius. The fact that yer here means you've got it settled, then?"""
un_032100_0190#0,"""Right you are, Zieg. Xiao gave it the green light. Can we count on you for a new line of Genesis Weapons?"""
un_032100_0200#0,"""Hmph... easier said than done! But as a craftsman there's no way I'm backin' down!"""
un_032100_0210#0,"""Oh yes! Missie, do you mind if I have another go at refurbishin' Clarissa?"""
un_032100_0220#0,"""She'll never be like the 'ol days, but if I take 'er apart and put 'er back together, we might come pretty darn close!"""
un_032100_0230#0,"""...Thanks, Zieg, but... I like Clarissa the way she is. We're a team."""
