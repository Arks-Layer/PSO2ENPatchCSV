st_031040_0040#0,"""Otherwise, it'll be too boring, you know?"""
st_031040_0050#0,"""They're coming again...! Kotoshiro, is there a way to escape..."""
st_031040_0060#0,"""...To protect the Miko's shrine. That is the Keeper's duty. You, however, should escape."""
st_031040_0070#0,"""Uuh, even if you say that... ...You too, right?"""

st_031040_0130#0,"""Fuuaaah... well, when they gather, they do so en masse. Is there perhaps a banquet?"""
st_031040_0140#0,"""Unfortunately, I am not in the mood for that. I'll humor you some other day!"""
st_031040_0150#0,"""You wiped out that entire army? Dark Falz, everything..."""
st_031040_0160#0,"""Kaka! Destroy'd they are not, merely return'd to where they ought be. Well, they should be in the Kuronite nation by now."""
st_031040_0170#0,"""Kotoshiro, oh Kotoshiro... Why did this fool not escape?"""
st_031040_0180#0,"""If t'were only thee t'would be a different story; involving our guests was foolish."""
st_031040_0190#0,"""...I have no excuses."""
st_031040_0200#0,"""...Kah, thou art tiresome. Thou might at least retort a little."""
st_031040_0210#0,"""In that case, if you came back and the shrine was no longer here, what would you do?"""
st_031040_0220#0,"""Kaka! Is't not obvious? Kotoshiro, I would smack thee."""
st_031040_0230#0,"""Thus, I kept protecting it."""
st_031040_0240#0,"""Art thou afeared of mine fist?"""
st_031040_0250#0,"""If it can crush planets, certainly."""

st_031040_0310#0,"""Kaka! I know at least this much. I am not a Miko simply for show."""
st_031040_0320#0,"""Once again, I graciously give these guests mine thanks."""

st_031040_0360#0,"""...I too, thank you for your cooperation. It is due to your efforts that I was able to protect these grounds."""
st_031040_0370#0,"""So, I believe I shall now take another nap within the shrine that thou hast protected."""
st_031040_0380#0,"""Please hold, Sukuna-hime. About the disputes around Harkotan..."""
st_031040_0390#0,"""I do not wait for unpleasant things to happen. I am tired, and thus, I shall sleep anon."""
