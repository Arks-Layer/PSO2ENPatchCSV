ra_039010_0010#0,"""Hey,<%me>.<br>You came at the right time."""
ra_039010_0020#0,"""……Ugh, my head's killing me."""
ra_039010_0030#0,"""You don't need to work on it right now. And don't worry, I'll get you setup with everything you need."""
ra_039010_0040#0,"""I don't think I'd be able to focus with all the information. But let's continue this anyways, I don't want to let anyone down!"""
ra_039010_0050#0,"""It won't be any good if you're trying to process this information without taking a break."""
ra_039010_0060#0,"""I've wanted to talk to <%me> anyways."""
ra_039010_0070#0,"""Talk about what?"""
ra_039010_0080#0,"""Well, the same thing I've been telling you, and I wanted to explain to <%me> about the current situation."""
ra_039010_0090#0,"""<%me>, I wanted to hand back control of ARKS Administration."""
ra_039010_0100#0,"""I'll still perform calculations and foresight, but general ARKS activities--I want Ulc and the Council of Six to deal with that."""
ra_039010_0110#0,"""We don't want to repeat history. And I want ARKS to be able to function without my assistance."""
ra_039010_0120#0,"""And that would allow me to calculate a way of defeating the [Profound Darkness] forever."""
ra_039010_0130#0,"""To be honest, I don't know if it's even possible. But not trying is worse than not trying. I don't want anyone to sacrifice themselves again."""
ra_039010_0140#0,"""The [Profound Darkness] is currently sealed thanks to you... well, specifically [Persona]."""
ra_039010_0150#0,"""When you interfere with the resurrection of the [Profound Darkness], you slowly drain it of its power."""
ra_039010_0160#0,"""When the [Profound Darkness] is weakened, [Persona] awakens and manages to initiate a temporal reversal."""
ra_039010_0170#0,"""However, that itself has its limits. When the [Profound Darkness] is pulled back in time, it's returned to the point before it is resurrected."""
ra_039010_0180#0,"""This has allowed us to keep the [Profound Darkness] sealed momentarily."""
ra_039010_0190#0,"""But that means, [Persona]..."""
ra_039010_0200#0,"""Correct. [Persona] is caught in a loop, and I don't know for how long as well."""
ra_039010_0210#0,"""It's why I want to figure out a way to prevent this from happening in the future."""
ra_039010_0220#0,"""Though, I have this funny feeling that it's going to be a rough process."""
ra_039010_0230#0,"""Ah, hey, this is serious!"""
ra_039010_0240#0,"""Afin?"""
ra_039010_0243#0,"""1. What's going on?"""
ra_039010_0246#0,"""2. Calm down Afin"""
ra_039010_0250#0,"""Oh, you're there too Partner? How should I explain..."""
ra_039010_0260#0,"""Uh, let's see... It just came from Yu-nee? No, from somewhere? It came out? No, born?"""
ra_039010_0270#0,"""Ahhh, I don't know to even explain this!"""
ra_039010_0280#0,"""Just get over here! You'll understand when you see it! Alright? Partner?"""
ra_039010_0290#0,"""Well now, that was something."""
ra_039010_0300#0,"""Afin's vitals seem just right, but the way he was talking... It was very odd."""
ra_039010_0310#0,"""A new future born, in front of our eyes. No one could possibly have seen any of this coming."""
ra_039010_0320#0,"""This will be the last Matterboard that you'll ever receive from me."""
ra_039010_0330#0,"""I have some ideas on helping you see possibilities, but that can wait."""
ra_039010_0340#0,"""We're counting on you, <%me>, always."""
