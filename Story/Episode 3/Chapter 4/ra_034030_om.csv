ra_034030_0010#0,"""<%me>... I know what's on your mind."""
ra_034030_0020#0,"""You're thinking of going back to 10 years ago, and everything will be clear, am I right?"""
ra_034030_0030#0,"""The thought has crossed my mind as well. But, I'm afraid it's not possible."""
ra_034030_0040#0,"""Any attempts at intervening in the timelines after the Second's disappearance are rejected. This is likely Xion's work."""
ra_034030_0050#0,"""Memories wiped, intervention prohibited. Seriously, she's such a slave driver."""
ra_034030_0060#0,"""At any rate, it seems like there's some people that still remember. They might know something."""
al_020050_0010#0,"""So that's why she tried to cover up Second's existence."""
al_020050_0020#0,"""She came that close to becoming a new [Profound Darkness]. Xion's own creation. Second Generation..."""
al_020050_0030#0,"""The knowledge she gave the Photoners allowed them to start toying with life. The result was her bitter legacy, the [Profound Darkness]."""
al_020050_0040#0,"""Xion created Second as an attempt to erase that mistake... But she, too, nearly became the [Profound Darkness]."""
al_020050_0050#0,"""Xion should have recreated Second and started over... But she couldn't bring herself to do it."""
al_020050_0060#0,"""For Second... that would have been toying with her life."""
al_020050_0070#0,"""I thought that Xion's apologies and regrets were about her giving knowledge to the Photoners."""
al_020050_0080#0,"""But that was wrong. She was apologizing to Second. She was repenting for her own actions."""
al_020050_0090#0,"""In a way, Second is like a daughter to Xion. It must have been very hard for her."""
al_020050_0100#0,"""That's why she wanted to save Second, no matter what. That's why she came to you for help..."""
al_020050_0110#0,"""I learned a lot from you going back to the past. No, to be honest, there are still a lot of things I don't know."""
al_020050_0120#0,"""You can't go back to the past any more. So from here on, I think I'll collect and connect fragments of memory, and search for the truth that way."""
