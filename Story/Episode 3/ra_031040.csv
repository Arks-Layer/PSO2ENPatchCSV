ra_031040_0010#0,"""Oh, <%me>. Look, it's that person from that day. Should we call out to him?"""
ra_031040_0020#0,"""Do you need anything from me?"""
ra_031040_0030#0,"""Eh? H-how did you notice us?"""
ra_031040_0040#0,"""Your aura is conspicuous even without the aid of vision. Sometimes, being able to see limits what you perceive."""
ra_031040_0050#0,"""Your eyes, they're..?"""
ra_031040_0060#0,"""That is correct. However, do not assume that lacking sight inconveniences me."""
ra_031040_0070#0,"""I can even sense the fact that you are not the Miko. There is no need to feel sorry for me."""
ra_031040_0080#0,"""I'm sorry... Are you offended?"""
ra_031040_0090#0,"""Your consideration is refreshing. Unlike the Shironians or Kuronites, you are gentle and kind."""
ra_031040_0100#0,"""Besides several others and I, you are completely different from the people of this planet. Interesting."""
ra_031040_0110#0,"""Erm... I'm sorry, but what is a \""Shironian\"" and \""Kuronite\""?"""
ra_031040_0120#0,"""They are the two native races of this planet. Shironians of the White Territory, and Kuronites of the Black Territory, divided by the Ei-namida river, never to meet."""
ra_031040_0130#0,"""However, Kuronites have been setting foot in the White Territory as of late."""
ra_031040_0140#0,"""\""Those who break the law of nature, shall be punished.\"" Clinging onto this law, the Shironians have been waiting... for the Ashen Miko's descent."""
ra_031040_0150#0,"""The Ashen Miko..."""
ra_031040_0160#0,"""The Kuronites that have set foot in the White Territory... The path they follow is one of impiousness."""
