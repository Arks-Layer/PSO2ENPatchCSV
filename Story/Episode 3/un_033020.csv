un_033020_0010#0,"""<%me>! I'm glad you're here."""
un_033020_0020#0,"""I was just talking to Sir Kotoshiro, and uh... I'm still not sure it's safe for their people to be fighting Darkers."""
un_033020_0030#0,"""...We spoke of this previously. I do not understand your concern... why do you insist we not engage them?"""
un_033020_0040#0,"""Well, without the power of Photons, you can't erase the Darkers... and their residue accumulates, corrupting life."""
un_033020_0050#0,"""You've seen it too, right? It's how [Double] manages to control the Kuronites."""
un_033020_0060#0,"""Then how do you explain that our warriors have waged countless battles, and yet none have shown symptoms of which you speak?"""

un_033020_0120#0,"""Those wicked twins! It hath to be them."""
un_033020_0130#0,"""If by cunning they deciev'd the Kuronites into believing they were alike mineself, t'would be easy to incite war."""
un_033020_0140#0,"""Nevertheless, this concerns you not. 'Tis our responsibility to protect our own."""
un_033020_0150#0,"""Quite besides, those giants deserve a hardy thrashing. Their arrogance is as monst'rous as their build."""
