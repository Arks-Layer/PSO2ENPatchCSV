st_035010_0010#0,"""It feels kinda anticlimactic that we got in so easily."""
st_035010_0020#0,"""'Tis but natural. I am this planet's Miko."""
st_035010_0030#0,"""Normally would the Kuron King hangeth his head and cometh to mine own shrine."""
st_035010_0040#0,"""That he submitteth a letter to entreat that I instead visit him...<br>He becometh quite conceited."""
st_035010_0050#0,"""Sukuna-hime, have you met the Kuron King?"""
st_035010_0060#0,"""But of course. I have endured the visitations of both kings many times since they took their thrones."""
st_035010_0070#0,"""Though the Shironian King hath an aptitude for cunning and trickery, I cannot but feel he is a coward, unsuited for the role of king."""
st_035010_0080#0,"""On the other hand, the Kuron King is a wise one indeed. Little love I have for his pridefulness, but I will admit he has his own peculiar charms."""
st_035010_0090#0,"""When we see him, you're going to suggest that the Kuronites are being manipulated by [Double], right?"""
st_035010_0100#0,"""Right enough. If the Kuronites take action, their rivalry will lead the Shironians also to act."""
st_035010_0110#0,"""Then shalt we findeth those ominous children and exorcise them in one stroke."""
st_035010_0120#0,"""And when 'tis done, no longer shall our people be sacrificed in vain."""
st_035010_0130#0,"""Heheh."""
st_035010_0140#0,"""What is it? What doth amuse thee, Matoi?"""
st_035010_0150#0,"""I was just thinking about how under that stern face, you really are a kind person."""
st_035010_0160#0,"""You're always talking about how much the planet means to you, but you treasure the Kuronites and the Shironians themselves, don't you?"""
st_035010_0170#0,"""Rather than treasure, t'would be better to call it mine duty."""
st_035010_0180#0,"""Duty?"""
st_035010_0190#0,"""Right so. 'Tis a duty engraved upon my body since the day I was born."""
st_035010_0200#0,"""As the legends speaketh, I was born to a Kuronite father and a Shironian mother, a child of ash. As such, both Shironians and Kuronites art mine relations."""
st_035010_0210#0,"""Black or white, I involve myself in their foolishness as little as I am able. But only a fiend would abandon their own kin in time of need."""
st_035010_0220#0,"""'Tis the fate I inherit from mine father and mother, and so I can do aught but follow it."""
st_035010_0230#0,"""...I'm sorry. I shouldn't have teased you about it."""
st_035010_0240#0,"""Kaka, worry not. T'was mere banter to pass the time. Thou couldst not have known what grave matters of which thou speaketh."""
st_035010_0250#0,"""Still, the desire to protect something or someone can give rise to power beyond even mine own divinity."""
st_035010_0260#0,"""Matoi, thou shouldst ponder what it is that thou desireth to protect."""
st_035010_0270#0,"""What I want to protect..."""
st_035010_0280#0,"""'Tis insufficient to speak of something so vague as \""everyone\"". Dost thou understandeth?"""
