st_035050_0010#0,"""That's quite the long face you have, my lady. Are you dissatisfied with that little fact I mentioned earlier?"""
st_035050_0020#0,"""Of course...! This all started because you Photoners created the Darkers...!"""
st_035050_0030#0,"""However, my lady, it was Xion who signed off on and approved of the creation of the source of all Darkers, the [Profound Darkness]."""
st_035050_0040#0,"""She must have realized it back then. With her computational abilities, she would have been able to see into the future to some extent."""
st_035050_0050#0,"""What the [Profound Darkness]'s creation would do to the Photoners, that is. She must have known."""
st_035050_0060#0,"""We Photoners lost our ability to use Photons in the battle against the [Profound Darkness], and so we created ARKS to use them for us."""
st_035050_0070#0,"""The [Profound Darkness] was sealed away, but the Dark Falz remained."""
st_035050_0080#0,"""And so, from that day unto this, ARKS have battled the Darkers. And what a pointless battle it has been."""
st_035050_0090#0,"""It's not pointless!"""
st_035050_0100#0,"""No, my lady, it is pointless."""
st_035050_0110#0,"""...The Dark Falz are individuals, and each has its own desires."""
st_035050_0120#0,"""Those desires are influenced by their hosts, becoming corrupted by them."""
st_035050_0130#0,"""[Elder] should be fairly easy to understand, I think? The host's influence was so strong, it forgot its original purpose, instead seeking only conflict for conflict's sake."""
st_035050_0140#0,"""[Apprentice] is the same. [Loser]...<br>Well, I didn't change much."""
st_035050_0150#0,"""However, [Double] is different. [Double] wields its power only for its one true purpose."""
st_035050_0160#0,"""True purpose...?"""
st_035050_0170#0,"""That purpose is nothing less than the revival of the [Profound Darkness]."""
st_035050_0180#0,"""The quickest way to revive the [Profound Darkness] is for it to consume all the other Dark Falz."""
st_035050_0190#0,"""In so doing, it will gather Darker Factor equivalent to the [Profound Darkness], and in short order it will awaken from its long slumber."""
st_035050_0200#0,"""Need I remind you, [Double] has already eaten [Apprentice] and [Loser]. By now, it has even consumed [Elder] as well."""
st_035050_0210#0,"""The countdown has already begun."""
st_035050_0220#0,"""The countdown until the [Profound Darkness] revives and annihilates this world, that is."""
st_035050_0230#0,"""1. Then we'll defeat the [Profound Darkness]."""
st_035050_0240#0,"""2. We'll destroy [Double] before that happens."""
st_035050_0250#0,"""The [Profound Darkness] is the source of all Dark Falz. Do you understand what that means? It can create as many Falz as it likes."""
st_035050_0260#0,"""If you're struggling with just one [Double], you don't stand a chance against a horde of them."""
st_035050_0270#0,"""Yes, that's probably the only way. If the [Profound Darkness] is revived, it will create more Dark Falz."""
st_035050_0280#0,"""If you're struggling with just one [Double], you wouldn't stand a chance against a horde of them."""
st_035050_0290#0,"""But don't forget, you're currently trapped within Dark Falz [Double]'s stomach."""
st_035050_0300#0,"""I don't get it. Just what is the [Profound Darkness]? Why would someone create that?"""
st_035050_0310#0,"""The [Profound Darkness] is an imitation of Xion. A man-made Akashic Record created by the Photoners."""
st_035050_0320#0,"""An artificial Akashic Record created to calculate and administer all things, a tool of convenience to enable mankind's sloth."""
st_035050_0330#0,"""But our great civilization was well into its decline...<br>Mankind's apathy, along with their other negative emotions, seeped into the creation process."""
st_035050_0340#0,"""Photons are very receptive to strong emotions. The greater in number they are, the more radical the effect is on the energy they produce."""
st_035050_0350#0,"""Thus they found they had created the [Profound Darkness]. The embodiment of all negative emotions, and sire to the Darkers, who sought to destroy all that exists."""
st_035050_0360#0,"""You asked an interesting question, my lady. Why was it created? I'd rather like to hear the answer to that myself."""
st_035050_0370#0,"""Why didn't she stop its creation, despite foreseeing such destruction?"""
st_035050_0380#0,"""But now, I feel I can understand her just a little."""
st_035050_0390#0,"""If I had to guess, I would say...<br>I would say she was lonely."""
