ra_039040_0010#0,"""Ah, it's you. I'm glad to see you again."""
ra_039040_0020#0,"""I'm growing bored of looking at the surly expressions on the faces of Eu and that boy there."""
ra_039040_0030#0,"""This planet is boring, too. Sand, sand and more sand, as far as the eye can see. What a desolate place."""
ra_039040_0040#0,"""What was this planet called again, Lillipa? Hmm... I don't believe we ever ruled such a place."""
ra_039040_0050#0,"""Hey, [Apprentice], cough up some answers already. What did you mean earlier when you said the [Profound Darkness] appeared \""again\""?"""
ra_039040_0060#0,"""Firstly, it's not \""Apprentice\"". My name is Aurora. Don't make that mistake again, Eu."""
ra_039040_0070#0,"""And I think what I said was clear enough. You have heard that the [Profound Darkness] was born in the era of the Photoners, yes?"""
ra_039040_0080#0,"""In fact, the [Profound Darkness] was our creation. And its birth caused us great difficulties."""
ra_039040_0090#0,"""Nobody expected our experiments to produce such a result. But when it emerged, we worked tirelessly to come up with countermeasures that would let us seal it away."""
ra_039040_0100#0,"""Even sealing it away is unimaginable to us. How did you do it?"""
ra_039040_0110#0,"""Hm? Let me think... Ah, yes. I wasn't involved in it myself, you see..."""
ra_039040_0120#0,"""But as I understand it, the [Profound Darkness] is the antithesis of Photons. It pursues and devours Photons wherever it finds them."""
ra_039040_0130#0,"""And so, we channelled all of our Photons into a single person, and sealed them away. The [Profound Darkness] followed them into the seal."""
ra_039040_0140#0,"""Forcing all your Photons into one person and sealing them away...<br>Are you sure that's what happened?"""
ra_039040_0150#0,"""As I said, I wasn't personally involved, but an Admiral I was acquainted with told me all about it afterwards."""
ra_039040_0160#0,"""...That's sick."""
ra_039040_0170#0,"""Sick? How so? It might be a distasteful idea, but one person's sacrifice saved an entire universe."""
ra_039040_0180#0,"""I'd think you'd understand our way of thinking a little better, Eu. As a former [Apprentice] host, and all."""
ra_039040_0190#0,"""Me...? Yeah, I guess I understand you. When I was [Apprentice], I wouldn't have thought twice about doing something like that."""
ra_039040_0200#0,"""But that doesn't stop me feeling angry about it now."""
ra_039040_0210#0,"""...I was being manipulated. Not just my memories, my way of thinking too."""
ra_039040_0220#0,"""......"""
ra_039040_0230#0,"""...Well, our seal may have worked, but then the Dark Falz came along and destroyed our civilization anyway.<br>So much for our great victory."""
ra_039040_0240#0,"""...You can say that again."""
ra_039040_0250#0,"""I'm bored of this area.<br>Take me to another."""
