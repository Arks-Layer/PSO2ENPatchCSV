ra_039040_0010#0,"""Ah, it's you. I'm glad to see you again."""
ra_039040_0020#0,"""I'm growing bored of watching Eu and that boy over there do nothing but sulk and pout."""
ra_039040_0030#0,"""This planet is boring, too. Sand, sand and more sand, as far as the eye can see. What a desolate place."""
ra_039040_0040#0,"""What was this planet called again, Lillipa? Hmmmmm... Was that one of the planets we had been governing?"""
ra_039040_0050#0,"""Hey, [Apprentice], cough up some answers already. What did you mean earlier when you said the [Profound Darkness] appeared \""again\""?"""
ra_039040_0060#0,"""Firstly, it's not \""Apprentice\"". My name is Aurora. Don't make that mistake again, Eu."""
ra_039040_0070#0,"""And I think what I said was clear enough. You have heard of the [Profound Darkness] that was born in the era of the Photoners, yes?"""
ra_039040_0080#0,"""Indeed, the [Profound Darkness] was created by we Photoners. And its birth caused us great difficulties."""
ra_039040_0090#0,"""Nobody expected our experiments to produce such a result. But when it emerged, we worked tirelessly to come up with countermeasures that would let us seal it away."""
ra_039040_0100#0,"""You sealed it away? How in the world did you manage that?"""
ra_039040_0110#0,"""Hm? Let me think... Ah, yes. I wasn't involved in it myself, you see..."""
ra_039040_0120#0,"""But as I understand it, the [Profound Darkness] is hostile towards anyone that uses Photons, and will pursue them until it devours and erases them."""
ra_039040_0130#0,"""And so, we channelled all of our Photons into a single person, and sealed them away along with the [Profound Darkness]."""
ra_039040_0140#0,"""Sorry, you... forced all your Photons into one person? And sealed them away? I don't understand. Are you sure that's what happened?"""
ra_039040_0150#0,"""As I said, I wasn't personally involved, but I was told that that was what happened by an Admiral whose word I trust implicitly."""
ra_039040_0160#0,"""...That's sick."""
ra_039040_0170#0,"""Sick? How so? One person's life to save an entire universe is more than a fair trade, isn't it?"""
ra_039040_0180#0,"""I figured you'd understand our way of thinking a little better, Eu. As a former [Apprentice] host, and all."""
ra_039040_0190#0,"""Me...? Yeah, I guess I can see it. When I was [Apprentice], I wouldn't have thought twice about doing something like that."""
ra_039040_0200#0,"""But that doesn't stop me feeling angry about it now."""
ra_039040_0210#0,"""...Everything about me was being manipulated. Not just my memories, but my way of thinking too."""
ra_039040_0220#0,"""......"""
ra_039040_0230#0,"""...Well, the seal may have worked, but the Dark Falz still managed to come along and destroy our civilization anyway.<br>So much for our great victory."""
ra_039040_0240#0,"""...You can say that again."""
ra_039040_0250#0,"""I'm bored of this area.<br>Take me to another."""
