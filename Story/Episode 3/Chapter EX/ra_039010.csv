ra_039010_0020#0,"""...Ugh, my head's killing me."""
ra_039010_0030#0,"""You don't have to start working on it right now. And don't worry, I'll get you set up with everything you need."""
ra_039010_0040#0,"""Having to read all of that will make my eyes glaze over...<br>I really want to make this handover work, so keep talking, and I'll listen!"""
ra_039010_0050#0,"""No, you need a break. You can't process all this information in one go."""
ra_039010_0060#0,"""Besides, I have something to talk to <%me> about."""
ra_039010_0070#0,"""What is it?"""
ra_039010_0080#0,"""Actually, the same thing you and I have been discussing."""
ra_039010_0090#0,"""Listen up, <%me>.<br>I'm planning to gradually relinquish control of ARKS administration."""
ra_039010_0100#0,"""I'll continue to provide computational and forecasting support, but the day-to-day management should be handled by Ulc and the Council of Six...<br>The people of ARKS."""
ra_039010_0110#0,"""We've all seen the dangers of over-centralizing our command structure. ARKS needs to be able to function without me. But most importantly..."""
ra_039010_0120#0,"""I want to focus on calculating a way to defeat the [Profound Darkness], and I mean permanently."""
ra_039010_0130#0,"""I don't know if it's even possible. But I can't afford not to try. I don't want anyone else to be sacrificed to stop it."""
ra_039010_0140#0,"""The [Profound Darkness] is currently sealed away, thanks to you...<br>Well, specifically thanks to [Persona]."""
ra_039010_0150#0,"""When you interfere with the resurrection of the [Profound Darkness], you slowly drain it of its power."""
ra_039010_0160#0,"""When the [Profound Darkness] is weakened, [Persona] awakens and manages to initiate a temporal reversal."""
ra_039010_0170#0,"""That pulls the [Profound Darkness] back in time, to right before the moment it resurrects.<br>...But that's the limit of their power."""
ra_039010_0180#0,"""As long as this process repeats, the [Profound Darkness] will be kept in a kind of stasis."""
ra_039010_0190#0,"""But then, [Persona]..."""
ra_039010_0200#0,"""Exactly. Persona is trapped in the same loop. And we don't know how long the cycle can hold."""
ra_039010_0210#0,"""That's the problem I want to devote all my power to. I want to calculate a way to save everyone."""
ra_039010_0220#0,"""Though, I have this funny feeling that it's going to be a rough process."""
ra_039010_0230#0,"""Problem! Big problem!!"""

ra_039010_0250#0,"""Oh, you're there too, partner! Uh, how can I explain this...?"""
ra_039010_0260#0,"""Uh, uhhhhh... Something... Appeared? Was born? From Lida? Maybe?"""
ra_039010_0270#0,"""Ahhh, how am I supposed to explain?!<br>I don't even get it myself!"""
ra_039010_0280#0,"""Look, just get over here right away! You'll understand when you see it for yourself! Hurry, partner!"""
ra_039010_0290#0,"""...Well. That was... something."""
ra_039010_0300#0,"""Afin's vitals all check out, so I doubt his life is in danger, but that level of panic was very unusual."""
ra_039010_0310#0,"""A new future is being born in front of our eyes. What it holds, nobody knows."""
ra_039010_0320#0,"""This will be the last Matter Board that you'll ever receive from me."""
ra_039010_0330#0,"""I have some ideas for how I can help visualize possibilities going forward...<br>But that will have to wait."""
