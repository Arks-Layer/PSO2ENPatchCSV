st_039010_0010#0,"""It's all clear to me now. This planet has [Apprentice]'s power sealed within it."""
st_039010_0020#0,"""...How could you possibly know that?"""
st_039010_0030#0,"""I'm a Dark Falz, of course!<br>Formerly, that is. And that means Eu should know too!"""
st_039010_0040#0,"""Don't lump me in with the likes of you."""
st_039010_0050#0,"""So cooold! You're no fun...<br>Well, to each her own, I suppose."""
st_039010_0060#0,"""That mining machine there must be what's suppressing [Apprentice]'s power, right? Maintaining the seal."""
st_039010_0070#0,"""...But I don't know anything about that machine, or even about this planet."""
st_039010_0080#0,"""This really is an unfamiliar time and place to me."""

st_039010_0130#0,"""...It looks like it is. There's all that smoke coming out of it."""
st_039010_0140#0,"""But if it's suppressing her power...<br>...Then what is this I'm sensing? Could there be some sort of catalyst ahead?"""
