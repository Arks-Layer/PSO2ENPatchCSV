ra_039050_0010#0,"""Oh, hey partner. We're still getting dragged around by this kid."""
ra_039050_0020#0,"""It's not actually all that bad, though."""
ra_039050_0030#0,"""Lida finds it hard to talk to other people about herself, after what she went through."""
ra_039050_0040#0,"""I think it'll be therapeutic for her to have someone around to talk to other than me."""
ra_039050_0050#0,"""That is, if they ever stop fighting long enough to talk..."""
ra_039050_0060#0,"""By the way, I haven't had a chance to go back to the ARKS ship recently. Is everything alright at home?"""
ra_039050_0070#0,"""Io and Fourier said something about ARKS' whole organizational structure changing. Don't they need your help with that, partner?"""
ra_039050_0080#0,"""I remember discussing a similar organizational overhaul in our time."""
ra_039050_0090#0,"""Don't bother. That sort of massive upheaval can only lead to trouble. Take it from someone who knows. """
ra_039050_0100#0,"""By the way, I've noticed Xion's scent coming from you."""
ra_039050_0110#0,"""How is Xion? Is she doing well?"""
ra_039050_0113#0,"""Xion is gone."""
ra_039050_0116#0,"""Xiao has taken her place."""
ra_039050_0120#0,"""Huh? What do you mean, gone? Xion no longer exists?"""
ra_039050_0130#0,"""There's a child who serves as a copy of her, but Xion herself is gone?<br>...I see."""
ra_039050_0140#0,"""Xiao? Who's that?<br>...A copy of Xion?<br>...Are you saying Xion is... gone?"""
ra_039050_0150#0,"""I see... Xion is no longer with us.<br>...I see..."""
ra_039050_0160#0,"""You've made a copy of Xion, but it's not Xion. Xion is gone..."""
ra_039050_0170#0,"""Ah, it's all coming back to me now. We also tried to create copies of Xion."""
ra_039050_0180#0,"""And we failed, each and every time."""
ra_039050_0190#0,"""Let me tell you the story of the End of the Photoners."""
ra_039050_0200#0,"""The Photoner civilization spread far and wide across the universe. Our administrative structure grew beyond our ability to manage, and so we tried to make a copy of Xion to do it for us."""
ra_039050_0210#0,"""Our first attempt produced a perfect copy. But we could not control it, so we discarded it into subspace."""
ra_039050_0220#0,"""Subspace, another dimension, I don't care what you call it. You threw it away like it was trash.<br>...You can't treat people like that."""
ra_039050_0230#0,"""Quite right. I agree with you entirely."""
ra_039050_0240#0,"""What happened next must have been our punishment for that."""
ra_039050_0250#0,"""Our following attempts led to failure after failure, until finally, we created another perfect copy, one that we thought we could control..."""
ra_039050_0260#0,"""But little did we know how our hearts would influence it. The dark thoughts and selfish desires of the entire Photoner race filled our creation..."""
ra_039050_0270#0,"""...And it became the [Profound Darkness]."""
ra_039050_0280#0,"""Exactly.<br>The darkness in the hearts of men is not a pretty sight."""
ra_039050_0290#0,"""...How do you know all this? Were you involved with its creation somehow?"""
ra_039050_0300#0,"""I, involved? Hah, not in the slightest.<br>I had no interest in any of that."""
ra_039050_0310#0,"""I only ever had one thing on my mind. Enhancing and preserving my beauty."""
ra_039050_0320#0,"""I was the most beautiful of all the Photoners. I stole the hearts of men across the universe. Some even called me the Goddess of Beauty herself."""
ra_039050_0330#0,"""Even military personnel and politicians fell for my charms. No man could resist me."""
ra_039050_0340#0,"""And one night with me was all it took for their deepest resentments and darkest secrets to come spilling out."""
ra_039050_0350#0,"""I heard all sorts of things from those men. Some that I wanted to hear, but so many that I wished I could forget."""
ra_039050_0360#0,"""I heard tales that made me want to close my ears and shut the words out. Of dark deeds done in dead of night, for power or for love or just for spite."""
ra_039050_0370#0,"""The ugliness of people who thought only of bringing each other down...<br>You've never seen anything like it."""
ra_039050_0380#0,"""But I was one of them too. Just ask any of the women I ruined because I feared they might one day rival me."""
