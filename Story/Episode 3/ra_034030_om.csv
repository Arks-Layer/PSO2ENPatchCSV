ra_034030_0010#0,"""<%me>... I know what's on your mind."""
ra_034030_0020#0,"""You're thinking of going back to 10 years ago, and everything will be clear, am I right?"""
ra_034030_0030#0,"""The thought has crossed my mind as well. But, I'm afraid it's not possible."""
ra_034030_0040#0,"""Any attempts at intervening in the timelines after the Second's disappearance are rejected. This is likely Xion's work."""
ra_034030_0050#0,"""Memories wiped, intervention prohibited. Seriously, she's such a slave driver."""
ra_034030_0060#0,"""At any rate, it seems like there's some people that still remember. They might know something."""
al_020050_0010#0,"""So this is the reason why they tried to cover up the existence of Second Generation."""
al_020050_0020#0,"""She nearly turned into a new [Profound Darkness]. Xion's own creation. Second Generation..."""
al_020050_0030#0,"""The knowledge that she imparted caused the Photoners to start toying with life. That is the bitter legacy, the [Profound Darkness]."""

al_020050_0070#0,"""I had thought that Xion's apologies and regrets were about her imparting knowledge to the Photoners."""
al_020050_0080#0,"""But that was wrong. She was apologizing to Second Generation. She was repenting for her own actions."""
al_020050_0090#0,"""In a way, Second Generation is like a daughter to Xion. It must have been very hard for her."""
al_020050_0100#0,"""That's why I want to save Second Generation, no matter what And had to depend on you for help..."""
