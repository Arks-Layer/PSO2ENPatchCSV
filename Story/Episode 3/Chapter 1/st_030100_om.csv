st_030100_0010#0,"""<%me>! Long time no see!"""
st_030100_0020#0,"""You were always busy, and I was getting my ARKS special permit, so..."""
st_030100_0030#0,"""It might not be worth saying... But, yeah! I'm happy."""
st_030100_0040#0,"""<%me>? Don't tell me that you forgot who I am?"""
st_030100_0050#0,"""I'm Matoi, remember? Ma. To. I.<br>Get it? Remember now?"""
st_030100_0060#0,"""1. Don't worry, Matoi. I haven't forgotten."""
st_030100_0070#0,"""2. You changed your clothes!"""
st_030100_0080#0,"""Eheh, it's been a while since you last said my name."""
st_030100_0090#0,"""Ah, uh-huh. It's to take a breather or to declare my intentions or..."""
st_030100_0100#0,"""I became an ARKS member. I finally got that special permit that I asked Xiao for so long ago!"""
st_030100_0110#0,"""Now I can finally stand beside you and help! I'll work hard from here on out!"""
st_030100_0120#0,"""That's why I called for you today.<br>Isn't that right, Xiao?"""
st_030100_0130#0,"""He gave me an administrative position within the ARKS!"""
st_030100_0140#0,"""Sorry, but before we get carried away, I'm going to need to give you one last lecture, Matoi."""
st_030100_0150#0,"""Eh? A lecture? ...I don't like lectures."""
st_030100_0160#0,"""Well, you don't have to say it like that. <%me> will be listening in as well."""
st_030100_0170#0,"""Then I'll listen!"""
st_030100_0180#0,"""...You're really simple-minded, aren't you?"""
st_030100_0190#0,"""Well, I said a \""lecture\"", but it's not exactly a \""lecture\"", per se."""
st_030100_0200#0,"""It's just an explanation of the ARKS current state of affairs."""
st_030100_0210#0,"""Let's omit the elaborate historical details. If you're interested in that, ask me about it separately."""
st_030100_0220#0,"""Okaaaay."""
st_030100_0230#0,"""...That response makes me anxious. Anyway, concerning ARKS:"""
st_030100_0240#0,"""The ARKS organization has managed to break away from Luther's control."""
st_030100_0250#0,"""However, we have also lost the existence known as [Xion]... That was inevitable."""
st_030100_0260#0,"""It's been half a year since we lost Xion. The rebuilding of the ARKS has finally gotten us back on track."""
st_030100_0270#0,"""In the half year since I said \""I'll perform management duties for the future\"", things have been very hectic."""
st_030100_0280#0,"""Now everyone behaves as if my being here is natural... like they've gotten used to everything, really."""
st_030100_0290#0,"""...Now that you've mentioned it, things look a bit different."""
st_030100_0300#0,"""Ah, that's all Ulc's work. \""If we're changing up ARKS, we're starting with appearances!\"", she said."""
st_030100_0310#0,"""\""I changed the Gate Area too!\"", she declared triumphantly, and just look around to see the results."""
st_030100_0320#0,"""Next, about the ARKS' enemies... the Darkers' current state."""
st_030100_0330#0,"""Honestly, it's not pretty."""
st_030100_0340#0,"""Destroying [Loser], who had rooted deep inside ARKS, was a significant gain."""
st_030100_0350#0,"""However, the sealed [Elder] has been revived, and [Apprentice] frequently attacks. And what's<br>more..."""
st_030100_0360#0,"""Both of you, please watch this footage."""
st_030105_0010#0,"""H-how... That planet was crushed so easily..."""
st_030105_0020#0,"""They replicated copies of the planets they consumed, and tried smashing them together...<br>Just like playing with a toy."""
st_030105_0030#0,"""They don't live for battle like Elder does. Nor are they searching for something like Apprentice is."""
st_030105_0040#0,"""They're accumulating pure, child-like pleasure from the act of destruction. The last, most terrifying Dark Falz [Double], is on the move."""
st_030105_0050#0,"""[Double]..."""
st_030105_0060#0,"""It seems that [Double] has targeted a new planet."""
st_030105_0070#0,"""Planet Harkotan. It's a recently discovered, civilized planet. [Double] is headed there."""
st_030105_0080#0,"""Then we need to hurry up and go there too!"""
st_030105_0090#0,"""That's right. Before that, there's one last thing to go through. About the ARKS' purpose."""
st_030105_0100#0,"""The ARKS' purpose is..."""
st_030105_0110#0,"""To defeat all the Darkers and Dark Falz in the entire universe, and save everyone."""
st_030105_0120#0,"""That's the only part I think you remembered, really."""
st_030105_0130#0,"""Ah, <%me>. Can I have a word before you go?"""
st_030105_0140#0,"""Don't let Matoi out of your sights... Stay with her as much as possible."""
st_030105_0150#0,"""We don't know when that [Persona] who appeared ten years ago will attack again... Also-"""
st_030105_0160#0,"""1. You don't have to say the rest."""
st_030105_0170#0,"""2. If the worst case happens?"""
st_030105_0180#0,"""That's reassuring to hear... but don't forget, <%me>."""
st_030105_0190#0,"""Yes. Should the worst case happen, we have to take immediate action. That's our duty of knowing the truth."""
st_030105_0200#0,"""Ten years ago, she nearly became the [Profound Darkness] itself. That's an irrefutable fact."""
st_030105_0210#0,"""She seems fine right now...<br>But there's no way of telling what might happen. For me, for you, and her."""
st_030105_0220#0,"""<%me>? What's wrong, let's hurry up and go."""
st_030105_0230#0,"""<%me>... I'll leave her to you."""
st_030105_0240#0,"""You know what to do right, Sara? If anything happens to them, contact me immediately."""
st_030105_0250#0,"""What scheme are you plotting this time..?"""
st_030105_0260#0,"""I'm only hoping that I won't have to."""
al_020060_0010#0,"""The future is finally clear for ARKS...<br>But Xion is no longer there to see it."""
al_020060_0020#0,"""If you change the past any more, it could change the future that Xion sacrificed herself to create. You have to avoid making any more major changes."""
al_020060_0030#0,"""Accept your painful past, and move forward. No more looking back. Well, I suppose that's how the world should be."""
al_020060_0040#0,"""As for the enemies who are trying to take that future away from you...<br>I'm very concerned about what these Dark Falz are doing. Particularly [Double]."""
al_020060_0050#0,"""Second's really pushing herself. It's scary to see her like this, knowing what could happen if she goes too far... Oh, what am I saying?"""
al_020060_0060#0,"""And this [Persona]... I'm not sure what to think. It seems to be able to anticipate your actions, to some extent... But it doesn't feel like it's able to actually see the future."""
al_020060_0070#0,"""Next is the black and white planet, Harkotan. I don't know anything about this one. What kind of planet is it?"""
