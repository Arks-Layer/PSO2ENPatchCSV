st_031040_0010#0,"""Wow! That one was really big, but they still managed to wipe it out."""
st_031040_0020#0,"""They've all been been wiped out, huh? They're putting up a bigger fight than I thought they would. Amazing! So amazing!"""
st_031040_0030#0,"""Well then, hopefully they've got a whooole bunch more amazing things to show us."""
st_031040_0040#0,"""If they don't, this'll turn out to be really boring, wouldn't it?"""
st_031040_0050#0,"""There's more of them...! Mr. Kotoshiro, you should run and--"""
st_031040_0060#0,"""It is my duty as a guard to protect my Lady's shrine. You two are the ones who should flee!"""
st_031040_0070#0,"""Mm-mm... We wouldn't even if you told us to... Right?"""
st_031040_0080#0,"""Well then, shall we..."""
st_031040_0090#0,"""...start round two?<br>...Er, hm? Huh?"""
st_031040_0100#0,"""This is... Ashen Wind!"""
st_031040_0110#0,"""...Goodness, all this unrest is rather disruptive to mine peaceful slumber."""
st_031040_0120#0,"""The obstinacy with which the Shironians and Kuronites ceaselessly quarrel is truly unto its own. 'Tis so disappointing as to be worthy of applause."""
st_031040_0130#0,"""Aaaah.. I say, there art many gathered unto this place. Is it thine intent to hold a banquet?"""
st_031040_0140#0,"""Alas, mine mood is ill suited for such festivities. Revise thy schedule."""
st_031040_0150#0,"""That huge army... just vanished? Dark Falz and all..."""
st_031040_0160#0,"""Hoho! 'Tis not that they vanished. They were merely sent out forthwith. Indeed, I should wager they art now deep within Kuron."""
st_031040_0170#0,"""Kotoshiro, O Kotoshiro. Why didst thy foolish self not flee?"""
st_031040_0180#0,"""While mayhaps I could understand wert thou alone, 'tis utterly foolish to involve mine guests."""
st_031040_0190#0,"""...I have no excuses."""
st_031040_0200#0,"""Hmph! How mundane. Raise at least some objection."""
st_031040_0210#0,"""Then, if I may, I must implore my Lady to return at once. What would we do without the shrine?"""
st_031040_0220#0,"""Hoho! That is thine objection? Kotoshiro, prepare to be punched."""
st_031040_0230#0,"""And so I shall steel myself."""
st_031040_0240#0,"""Dost thou fear mine fists?"""
st_031040_0250#0,"""They can destroy entire planets, so I certainly do."""
st_031040_0260#0,"""Thou shant jest. I like this planet, and I am not wont to destroy things I like."""
st_031040_0270#0,"""However, Kotoshiro, you do have mine thanks for protecting the shrine."""
st_031040_0280#0,"""Oh, but of course. I must needs extend mine thanks to the guests."""
st_031040_0290#0,"""Many thanks to thee, <%me>, and Matoi."""
st_031040_0300#0,"""Huh? How do you know our names...?"""
st_031040_0310#0,"""Hoho! I am privy to that much. I am the Miko of this shrine, after all."""
st_031040_0320#0,"""Once again, dear guests, mine deepest thanks."""
st_031040_0330#0,"""I am Sukunahime. I am known as the Ashen Miko. I am pleased to meet thee."""
st_031040_0340#0,"""Ashen Miko, Lady Sukunahime... O-On the contrary, the pleasure is ours."""
st_031040_0350#0,"""Hoho! Thou needn't be so formal. I am in thy debt. Wouldn'st thou agree, Kotoshiro?"""
st_031040_0360#0,"""...You have my thanks as well. Thanks to you, we were able to protect this land."""
st_031040_0370#0,"""Well, I do believe I shall return to my slumber in the selfsame shrine which thee and thine protected."""
st_031040_0380#0,"""Please wait, Lady Sukunahime! All of Harkotan is beset with quarreling--"""
st_031040_0390#0,"""I will not wait. I am beset with fatigue. And so I shall slumber forthwith."""
st_031040_0400#0,"""...I regret that you had to see that."""
st_031040_0410#0,"""Oh, d-don't worry about it."""
st_031040_0420#0,"""...You've got it rough, huh."""
st_031040_0430#0,"""That's... Miko-sama?"""
st_031040_0440#0,"""...I appreciate your understanding."""
st_031040_0450#0,"""I understand what you want to say, but I ask that you do not. I am still her protector."""
