un_031120_0010#0,"""Oh? It's you! Do you need Lisa for something?"""
un_031120_0020#0,"""Lisa's just casually going around fighting things just for something to do."""
un_031120_0030#0,"""Now that things have calmed down a bit amongst the ARKS, things have gotten less exciting."""
un_031120_0040#0,"""That being said, Lisa would find it hard to tell you this place is all that exciting either..."""
un_031120_0050#0,"""The best they've got are those big Kuronite people. There's also Darkers, so there's plenty of stuff to shoot and hunt! But, well..."""
un_031120_0060#0,"""But how come the Shironite people worship Lisa? Why is that?"""
un_031120_0070#0,"""When Lisa shoots one of those Kuronite people, the Shironites make a big fuss and start cheering for her. It's really bad for Lisa's mood, you know?"""
un_031120_0080#0,"""Lisa even tried shooting one of the Shironites, but they just keep worshipping her. It's awful. Lisa might have met her match."""
un_031120_0090#0,"""...Then again, if this means Lisa doesn't have to watch where she's aiming, her job will be much easier. Hehehe."""
