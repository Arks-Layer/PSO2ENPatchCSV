un_065120_0010#0,"""Hey, <%me>.<br>It's been a while, hasn't it? I'm glad to see that you've been getting along well."""
un_065120_0020#0,"""Oh, that's right. Thanks to Xiera's efforts, the ARKS ships have become almost fully autonomous."""
un_065120_0030#0,"""After handing over control, I've found myself with a lot more free time. So I've spent my time running calculations about the distant future."""
un_065120_0040#0,"""Calculations are all there is for you to do?"""
un_065120_0050#0,"""Where is Xiera anyways?"""
un_065120_0060#0,"""Haha. Don't look so worried. This is a future woven by the wishes of all people. I could never get bored with it."""
un_065120_0070#0,"""Oh, Xiera went out for a bit. She seemed to have some things she wanted to do, but she should be calling back any moment right about now."""
un_065120_0080#0,"""Xiao, this is Xiera! I'm here to deliver a report on the interviews!"""
un_065120_0090#0,"""Today's theme is \""Improving work-friendly environments for the women of ARKS\""!"""
un_065120_0100#0,"""Ah, feel free to listen in if you want, <%me>!"""
un_065120_0110#0,"""This is something Xiera started up recently. She said she wanted more freedom to go out and gather the opinions of everyone in ARKS."""
un_065120_0120#0,"""Ulc and I are of the same mind, actually. It's important for an organization to really consider the opinions of its subjects."""
un_065120_0130#0,"""Well, here's my report! First, a perspective from the lovely Sara."""
un_065120_0140#0,"""\""Be more thankful for my concerns! Also, stop patting my head!\"""""
un_065120_0150#0,"""Ah, I see. Denied. I'll be sure to show more thanks for her concern, but I'm still going to pat her on the head."""
un_065120_0160#0,"""Moving on, a perspective from our beloved Guardian Matoi."""
un_065120_0170#0,"""\""I want to keep protecting everyone's happiness. So long as I can do that, I'll be fine.\"""""
un_065120_0180#0,"""Yes, I see. Not exactly relevant to the question theme, but a very Matoi response indeed. Who's next?"""
un_065120_0190#0,"""\""Promotion of information dealers! Also, praise Patty for being awesome!\"""""
un_065120_0200#0,"""And beside her, a sighing Tia."""
un_065120_0210#0,"""Peculiarities aside, I'm actually kind of interested in what would happen if Patty and Tia were recruited into the Intelligence Division."""
un_065120_0220#0,"""And that's all for today! While I'm here, I also have my own input! With regard to female Cast chest-parts..."""
un_065120_0230#0,"""Sorry, Xiera! Went and slipped my hand and disconnected you, I did. Haha."""
un_065120_0240#0,"""So yeah, as you can see ARKS is carrying on quite peacefully, isn't it?"""
un_065120_0250#0,"""Peaceful everyday life... Quite the miracle you were destined to bring about, I'll say."""
un_065120_0260#0,"""But I wonder every now and then... Didn't all the other miracles we had in the past just lead us down a path of ruin?"""
un_065120_0270#0,"""Even a miracle like Xion only led to another repeat of conflict and tragedy. Because apparently that was the \""correct\"" history."""
un_065120_0280#0,"""Ahaha. Don't give me such a grim look. Sorry, I went and said something untoward."""
un_065120_0290#0,"""Any future is going to be a path we all walk down together, you know. Whatever changes may come about, that's the \""miracle\"" I'm hoping for."""
