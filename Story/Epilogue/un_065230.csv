un_065230_0020#0,"""Until very recently, I was putting all my energy into Anti-Photoner A.I.S. development and maintenance, so I only just got around to reading the final report."""
un_065230_0030#0,"""The report that details precisely how indebted we are to you, that is."""
un_065230_0040#0,"""Really, your combat data was truly invaluable when it came to this research."""
un_065230_0050#0,"""At first I had to check with the managers to see if it was correct, and sure enough, it turns out you're the Guardian. Thank you very much."""
un_065230_0060#0,"""In addition I was also given access to your past combat data, and even that was absolutely fascinating."""
un_065230_0070#0,"""We're making plans to use your data not just with regards to the Anti-Photoner battle, but with efficient Darker extermination as a whole."""
un_065230_0080#0,"""A researcher's work is never done. To make sure we're always one step ahead, our research will continue ever onward."""

un_065230_0110#0,"""We had all but given up hope on a manned-flight test, but... you're free, aren't you? You're also really durable, I'm sure you'd be fine!"""
un_065230_0120#0,"""Ahh, you're a life saver. I am SO glad to have met you. So, ready to get started with the test?"""

un_065230_0140#0,"""Give me 10 years."""
un_065230_0150#0,"""Yes, I understand. You'll be experiencing around 800,000 g's, so please take any precautions you need."""
un_065230_0160#0,"""Very funny! We don't have the luxury to wait 10 years! Is this some sort of Guardian inside joke?"""
un_065230_0170#0,"""Ah, wait... We could get better data if we removed the shock absorbers and safety measures."""
un_065230_0180#0,"""Oh, we have so much testing to do.<br>Wait, <%me>! Why are you running?! Hey!!"""
