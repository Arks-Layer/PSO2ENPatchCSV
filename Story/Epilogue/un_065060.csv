un_065060_0010#0,"""Yo! Partner! Welcome back!"""
un_065060_0020#0,"""I never doubted you, but wow... You really brought down a monster like that? You really are the best ARKS has to offer, no doubt!"""
un_065060_0030#0,"""Though thinking about it, I could tell you were a cut above the rest even back when we were doing our final training."""
un_065060_0040#0,"""You took on those Darkers without so much as flinching, while I was off to the side, scared out of my wits!"""
un_065060_0050#0,"""And then those times you helped me out with my investigations... Oh, and the time we both entered that Battle Championship!"""
un_065060_0060#0,"""And after that, saving Yuki and repelling those Dark Falz, not to mention fighting the [Profound Darkness] itself..."""
un_065060_0070#0,"""And now you're the Guardian, the face of ARKS! You're so much more than just my partner now, huh? Heheh. For all you've done... Thank you!"""
un_065060_0080#0,"""I'll always be your partner."""
un_065060_0090#0,"""You're right about that."""
un_065060_0100#0,"""Hehe... Giving me that look kinda makes me worried that you're just kidding!"""
un_065060_0110#0,"""Wha--! Ouch, partner! You're just kidding, right?"""
un_065060_0120#0,"""You always keep a completely straight face when you're joking. Even when I know you're kidding, it still catches me off guard. Well, anyways..."""
un_065060_0130#0,"""Thank you for everything, really! Here's to our future... partner!"""
