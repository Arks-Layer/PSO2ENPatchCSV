un_065140_0010#0,"""Who would've thought the rookie we helped through the training course would end up becoming the one to defeat the [Profound Darkness]."""
un_065140_0020#0,"""As I remember it, Darkers showed up on Naberius and you ran off to go help them."""
un_065140_0030#0,"""I didn't run off, you were just slow. Anyways, I'm sure the future Guardian wouldn't have even needed my help anyways."""
un_065140_0040#0,"""Speaking of which, do you remember?"""
un_065140_0050#0,"""At the end of your training course, I looked at you and said \""Haven't I seen you somewhere before?\"""""
un_065140_0060#0,"""Well, you sure did seem familiar. I was wondering if you were related to my teacher who helped me out before I became ARKS."""
un_065140_0070#0,"""Teacher? Whenever you say something nice like that, it sounds like you were told to say it. Well?"""
un_065140_0080#0,"""Cut it out. I use the word teacher because I want to."""
un_065140_0090#0,"""Well, I've remembered what it was that seemed familiar. Your whole atmosphere, the way you carry yourself, it's a perfect match to my teacher."""
un_065140_0100#0,"""But didn't your teacher disappear somewhere over 10 years before then?"""
un_065140_0110#0,"""And, \""atmosphere\""? I think you're just making <%me> feel uncomfortable now."""
un_065140_0120#0,"""Yeah, I know. There's not much to be done about it. As you know, my memory is a little foggy around that time."""
un_065140_0130#0,"""To be honest, I can't even really remember my teacher's face. Still, whenever you're around, you remind me of my teacher from time to time."""
un_065140_0140#0,"""I wonder what teacher's up to these days."""
un_065140_0150#0,"""I wonder if I stayed true to teacher's teachings..."""
un_065140_0160#0,"""You sure did."""
un_065140_0170#0,"""You still need to work on your diligence."""
un_065140_0180#0,"""Yeah, you're right... I should be proud of that!"""
un_065140_0190#0,"""My diligence, huh. True. You're right there, I've still got a ways to go."""
un_065140_0200#0,"""Still, even your words just now sounded like something teacher would say to me. Man, that's really weird."""
un_065140_0210#0,"""That's just like you, Zeno. Still, I have to agree. Who would've thought the new recruits would turn out like this!"""
un_065140_0220#0,"""You and Matoi are really something else, you know? On the one hand, you became the only two Guardians of ARKS."""
un_065140_0230#0,"""And on the other hand, you reunited Afin with his sister when she was under the influence of [Apprentice]. You're really in a league of your own."""
un_065140_0240#0,"""...But, if I'm gonna say that, I also have to bring up how unbelievable it is that Zeno became one of the Council of Six!"""
un_065140_0250#0,"""Yeah, I put my nose to the grindstone there. Well, since Echo worried about me so much, it's not that nice of a memory."""
un_065140_0260#0,"""And then I became a Hunter and stuff... I don't regret it, but I think that caused more trouble for the people around me.."""
un_065140_0270#0,"""It all led up to who you are now."""
un_065140_0280#0,"""Your marriage is the biggest shock of all."""
un_065140_0290#0,"""That's true. We've lived some pretty hectic lives, all to be able to stand stand here today."""
un_065140_0300#0,"""Ah... yeah... sorry. It's kind of embarrassing when you bring it up like that."""
un_065140_0310#0,"""Our past, the peace of today beyond... they're both strongly linked together. And because of that, we reunited, and eventually married."""
un_065140_0320#0,"""...Yeah. We should all be really proud of the peace we were able to achieve."""
un_065140_0330#0,"""Oh yeah! While you're here, you want to come with us on our honeymoon thing? Afin, Matoi, everyone's coming along!"""
un_065140_0340#0,"""<%me>.<br>Don't look confused, you're coming too. Everyone who fought for peace is invited!"""
un_065140_0350#0,"""Yup, darn right! Come on, let's get going, <%me>!"""
