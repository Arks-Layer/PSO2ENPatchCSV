un_065080_0020#0,"""From here on, it's safe to say we're going to have a bit more free time to do the things we want."""
un_065080_0030#0,"""What I want to do? Yeah, I gotta go with honing my Katana skills."""
un_065080_0040#0,"""Oh, now that's a look. You look like you're wondering why I'd still be training at a time like this?"""
un_065080_0050#0,"""Well, you see, the Katana also happens to be something you can discipline yourself with."""
