un_054010_0020#0,"""Ah, <%me>...<br>No, Sorry. It's nothing."""
un_054010_0030#0,"""Somehow, for a moment there you looked like Master Gettemhart...<br>Please forget I said anything."""
un_054010_0040#0,"""Oi. Keep your mouth shut if you know what's good for you."""
un_054010_0050#0,"""Umm... <%me>. Is something troubling you?"""
un_054010_0060#0,"""1. Do you wish you could see Gettemhart?"""
un_054010_0070#0,"""2. It's nothing..."""
un_054010_0080#0,"""Yeah. More than anything..."""
un_054010_0090#0,"""Thank you for worrying about me... I'm alright, really."""
un_054010_0100#0,"""If I somehow had the chance to talk to Master Gettemhart again..."""
un_054010_0110#0,"""I'd want to tell him all the things I couldn't say when I was disguised as my sister... as Melphonsina."""
un_054010_0120#0,"""If we ever meet again, I... I think I could talk to him as myself."""
un_054010_0130#0,"""...No, that's silly of me to think. If we did meet again, I'd probably freeze up from nervousness and wouldn't be able to say anything at all."""
un_054010_0140#0,"""When you know you'll never see someone again, you're free to think of all the things you'd tell them if they were in front of you. That's all it was."""
un_054010_0150#0,"""Dreams are nice, but what makes them dreams is that we can't have them. All I can do is live my life in the here and now."""
un_054010_0160#0,"""That was the last order he gave me. I can still hear his words so clearly...<br>Thinking about it makes me feel a little lonely, but I'll be alright."""
un_054010_0170#0,"""Ah, I'm sorry. I don't know how we got onto this topic...<br>...I just had this strange nostalgic feeling."""
un_054010_0180#0,"""Sorry for rambling on. I'll see you later."""
un_054010_0190#0,"""Tch. You're a real pain in the ass with your meddling, you know that?"""
