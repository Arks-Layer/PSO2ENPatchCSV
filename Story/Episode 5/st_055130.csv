st_055130_0020#0,"""...<%me>. Is it affecting your body?"""
st_055130_0030#0,"""Oh, what's this? I'm being talked about by the shot callers?"""
st_055130_0040#0,"""Heh, you can relax. I won't be causing trouble any time soon."""
st_055130_0050#0,"""I'm far too fascinated by what goes on in this place inside of you. Why would I bother with some trifling nonsense?"""
st_055130_0060#0,"""You'd best behave as well, you know. It would be bad for you if I had to deal with something. Get me?"""
st_055130_0070#0,"""<%me>...? You went pale all of a sudden. Are you really alright?"""
st_055130_0080#0,"""Perfectly fine."""
st_055130_0090#0,"""Oh no! Luther's taking over!"""
st_055130_0100#0,"""Right. I hope so. I'm just a little worried after you gained Luther's power."""
st_055130_0110#0,"""Really?! W-we have to purify you right away! Clarissa! Clarissa!"""
st_055130_0120#0,"""<%me>, stop teasing her. Especially about something like this."""
st_055130_0130#0,"""So you gained the powers of [Loser] this time... But the data shows no abnormalities. Your Darker Factor hasn't risen either."""
st_055130_0140#0,"""It seems, as with [Elder], there's no imminent danger to deal with."""
st_055130_0150#0,"""We should think of ways to analyze your abilities as well as the situation in Omega."""
st_055130_0160#0,"""It seems Luther shed his mortal form in order to rid himself of the Ephimera from the Crimson Evil Dragon, but..."""

st_055130_0180#0,"""Omega's Luther had quite a sharp tongue, but he was a good brother who cared about his sister. Right, <%me>?"""
