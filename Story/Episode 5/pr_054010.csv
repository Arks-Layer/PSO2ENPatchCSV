pr_054010_0010#0,"""The Crimson Evil Dragon... So it's finally here."""
pr_054010_0020#0,"""My apologies, Guardian. It's rather useless of me to place such a burden on yourself..."""
pr_054010_0030#0,"""Now, now, let's not say such things Alisa. Instead, let's go over the plans."""
pr_054010_0040#0,"""I will concentrate on preparing the barrier and seal for the Crimson Evil Dragon."""
pr_054010_0050#0,"""As long as the Evil Dragon is inside the barrier, its movement will be slowed. That is when I want you to defeat it."""
pr_054010_0060#0,"""This is the Laconium Sword. Legends say that it can pierce the scales of the Evil Dragon."""
pr_054010_0065#0,"""Guardian, I'll entrust this to you. I will duplicate it within the barrier. I hope it will aid you for this."""
pr_054010_0070#0,"""The scales of the Evil Dragon will regenerate old wounds. But within this barrier, it's possible to recognize its weakness."""
pr_054010_0075#0,"""And when you hit a weak spot with this sword, it will open the old wound from the scales of the dragon."""
pr_054010_0080#0,"""In other words, if we focus our attacks on the exposed wounds..."""
pr_054010_0090#0,"""Yes, even the Crimson Evil Dragon will fall. If its power is weakened, and we cannot seal it, the trapped soul within should still be freed."""
pr_054010_0100#0,"""Guardian... Once again, I thank you."""
