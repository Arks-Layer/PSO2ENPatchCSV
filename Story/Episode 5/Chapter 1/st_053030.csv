st_053030_0010#0,"""It had been announced that the reasoning for the Prime Minister and his<br>cohorts to slay the previous king was because he abandoned his nation's<br>sovereignty and adopted policies that undermined his people."""
st_053030_0020#0,"""The Sword Maiden, Alisa, also heard the reports.<br>Signed documents that detailed these policies had been discovered<br>with the king's signature and were checked for inconsistencies."""
st_053030_0030#0,"""However, a strange feeling loomed throughout the nation.<br>Why would a king known for his gentle nature seek the<br>destruction of Ephimera and the Devil Castles so vehemently?"""
st_053030_0040#0,"""As the Sword Maiden, Alisa had<br>to get to the bottom of this."""
st_053030_0050#0,"""The Sword Maiden traveled alone, without company, surprising<br>Harriet and the others as they came out to welcome her."""
st_053030_0060#0,"""I thank you for agreeing to speak with me."""
st_053030_0070#0,"""Lady Alisa, the Sword Maiden... I am honored by your presence."""
st_053030_0080#0,"""Please rise. The duty of my house is only to bear the legendary sword and the hero's strength, we do not involve ourselves in the politics of the nation."""
st_053030_0090#0,"""But Lutz is your uncle, is he not? Wouldn't your feelings for a blood-relative surface?"""
st_053030_0100#0,"""If you put it that way, then as descendants of legends, both of you have ties with me even stronger than blood."""
st_053030_0110#0,"""And so, what did you come<br>here to speak about...?"""
st_053030_0120#0,"""The Devil Castles... no, Ephimera. I wanted to know the truth about them."""
st_053030_0130#0,"""What would listening to your enemy's excuses do for you? Your uncle already knows where we stand."""
st_053030_0140#0,"""The Devil Castles are my uncle's prized treasure. If they're to be destroyed, then I can already foresee the outcome of this battle."""
st_053030_0150#0,"""To whom shall I lend my strength and sword? Is this the rightful place I should bestow myself? That is all I wish to puzzle together."""
st_053030_0160#0,"""Upon using Ephimera, it corrupts the mind from the inside... It only allows for thoughts about itself and influences their will and malice towards<br>others."""
st_053030_0170#0,"""I was the one who discovered this, through the development of the Devil Castle, and handed my data to the King, proposing a ban on the use of Ephimera. He agreed and enforced a policy that banned it."""
st_053030_0180#0,"""The Prime Minister and his followers opposed, and subsequently assassinated the King. Harriet and I were then branded as traitors, and thus the takeover of the nation was complete."""
st_053030_0190#0,"""Do you expect me to believe such a grandiose story without any evidence?"""
st_053030_0200#0,"""You should have encountered plenty of evidence already. After all, you are Prime Minister Lutz's niece."""
st_053030_0210#0,"""No way... Are you implying he's...?"""
st_053030_0220#0,"""The Prime Minister we knew was kind and gentle, whose only thoughts were for this nation and its people. Even my father had poured an overwhelming amount of faith into him."""
st_053030_0230#0,"""Even during the defense of this nation, it was Lutz who took the initiative of summoning more Devil Castles than anyone else..."""
st_053030_0240#0,"""And from the overuse of Ephimera, its negative effects took hold of him..."""
st_053030_0250#0,"""The Devil Castles he built for this nation and its people will be destroyed by us, for the sake of this world."""
st_053030_0260#0,"""Quite the irony."""
st_053030_0270#0,"""Brother..."""
st_053030_0280#0,"""And that concludes our story. What you choose to believe is up to you."""
st_053030_0290#0,"""But I assume that you had already made your decision."""
st_053030_0300#0,"""What do you mean..."""
st_053030_0310#0,"""Lady Harriet! We have a report! We've spotted a large summoning being held at the plains in front of the camp... A Devil Castle is being summoned!"""
st_053030_0320#0,"""It can't be...! There shouldn't be any forces out there!"""
st_053030_0330#0,"""It's possible that they had already made their move as you were here with us."""
st_053030_0340#0,"""To use the Sword Maiden... no, to use your own niece as a pawn in your plans. It seems your insanity reaches new heights, Lutz."""
st_053030_0350#0,"""Oh, Uncle..."""
