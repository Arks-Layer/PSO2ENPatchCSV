st_052100_0020#0,"""There aren't many who would know me by both face and name..."""
st_052100_0030#0,"""...Unless, of course, you are a spy...<br>working for Lutz."""
st_052100_0040#0,"""Brother! Surely you jest! This noble soul saved me when I was pursued by his men!"""
st_052100_0050#0,"""You lack foresight, Harriet. Did you never consider that this could be part of a greater scheme? Perhaps to follow us home, and find our hideout..."""
st_052100_0060#0,"""Brother!"""
st_052100_0070#0,"""I understand, I understand. Please calm down. The crown princess should not raise her voice like that."""
st_052100_0080#0,"""The same goes to you, my older brother."""
st_052100_0090#0,"""My claim to the throne is long passed. I no longer have an underlying royal duty to bind my thoughts, actions, or the subjects of my research."""
st_052100_0100#0,"""I see! This must be what Alma was talking about!"""
st_052100_0110#0,"""It's like the records of what has been have all been messed up. Since this is basically a dream, anything within the bounds of possibility can become a reality!"""
st_052100_0120#0,"""But... Luther, of all people, as Harriet's brother? This exceeds all rational notions of plausibility..."""
st_052100_0130#0,"""Hey! Watch out!<br>What're you doing?!"""
st_052100_0140#0,"""Hmm... a fairy?<br>Just as the legends describe it..."""
st_052100_0150#0,"""Then you must be... a savior from another world. Just as has been foretold."""
st_052100_0160#0,"""Y-you know that we're from another world?!"""
st_052100_0170#0,"""I am one of this world's foremost magical researchers. I can tell simply by examining the flow of your Mana. It is clearly different from that which the humans of this world possess."""
st_052100_0180#0,"""Besides which, this is a world of Summoners. And it is I who invented summoning in the first place."""
st_052100_0190#0,"""I would never have begun such research without believing in the existence of other worlds, now would I?"""
st_052100_0200#0,"""That aside, I have questions about you. That form should permit neither flight nor the ability to understand human speech."""
st_052100_0210#0,"""Our legends attribute such gifts to you, but I'm fascinated to learn how they work. Would it trouble you to become the subject of my research?"""
st_052100_0220#0,"""Even in an alternate universe, he's the same as ever!"""
st_052100_0230#0,"""Hey! Listen!<br>Please, help meee!"""
st_052100_0240#0,"""1. Perhaps another time."""
st_052100_0250#0,"""2. Please don't tease her."""
st_052100_0260#0,"""Hmm... very well.<br>Now, for our primary concern..."""
st_052100_0270#0,"""Oh, I'm quite serious...<br>Ah, but my dear sister's bitter gaze speaks of her distaste for this subject. Very well then, we shall proceed with our more pressing concern."""
st_052100_0280#0,"""Allow me to explain the current state of affairs within our country, and what has led us to this civil war."""
