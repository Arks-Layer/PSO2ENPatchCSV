st_056100_0010#0,"""Guided by its Divine Queen, Margareta, Harriet and the Guardian<br>made their way towards the Holy Kingdom of Epic."""
st_056100_0020#0,"""Both the fortresses and the villages on the border<br>were completely devoid of Epic's civilians,<br>with only the traces of a hasty evacuation left."""
st_056100_0030#0,"""As the people had evacuated, the damage to property and<br>harm to them were minimal. However, Margareta was still torn<br>that she had to force her people to evacuate their homes."""
st_056100_0040#0,"""And yet she remained firm that if the problem were solved,<br>all would be able to be restored to how it was."""
st_056100_0050#0,"""After passing beyond the silent villages,<br>they came upon the vast and sprawling desert."""
st_056100_0060#0,"""The Kingdom of Epic had fallen into the hands of four great evils.<br>In order to reclaim it, the Guardian and their entourage<br>pressed onward into the desert..."""
st_056100_0070#0,"""So, this is what Epic looks like...<br>It's kind of... bleak."""
st_056100_0080#0,"""The Holy Kingdom of Epic was established by those who had pledged to a life of austerity. A land that proved to be harsh upon the body and mind is exactly what they were after, I wager."""
st_056100_0090#0,"""Exactly. The original founders came here as a place to hone their minds. Eventually more people came and they formed a town, and later became a full nation."""
st_056100_0100#0,"""The Holy Kingdom of Epic blesses the pious and virtuous! And sitting atop the highest throne is none other than I, the Divine Queen of Epic, Margareta!"""
st_056100_0110#0,"""...And yet you seem like the furthest thing possible from a pious individual."""
st_056100_0120#0,"""Why... you... little... fairy!"""
st_056100_0140#0,"""There seem to be no signs of any Devil Castles here..."""
st_056100_0150#0,"""Devil Castles? We don't really need those disturbing things aside from at the kingdom's borders. There's no reason for anyone to invade us anyways."""
st_056100_0160#0,"""Besides, if we used them the same way you did, the land would become more barren than it already is!"""
st_056100_0170#0,"""Only two types would summon them all over like that anyways - Idiots who don't know how to think ahead, and people in a land as bountiful with mana as Cuent."""
st_056100_0190#0,"""Bountiful... Do you truly think Cuent is that bountiful?"""
st_056100_0200#0,"""I agree that the lands are rich with resources and mana, but such things alone are not enough for the spirits of our people, are they not?"""
st_056100_0210#0,"""Hah, what a naive way to think. If the Queen<br>won't take pride in her country, then who will? Are you trying to make your people uneasy on purpose?"""
st_056100_0220#0,"""Just look around. There's not a shred of fertile land in this blasted desert. That's the kind of barren country Epic is."""
st_056100_0230#0,"""That line of thought will spiral downward forever. That's why I always strive to be beautiful and proud, so that my people may aspire to do the same."""
st_056100_0240#0,"""If they think 'Ah, I want to be like her', then that means I've done my job. That aspiration is what drives people to greater heights."""
st_056100_0250#0,"""Do you... never worry of alienating your people?"""
st_056100_0260#0,"""Don't be absurd, if I were afraid of people being jealous, how could I ever be Queen?"""
st_056100_0270#0,"""Well... Truth be told, I am a little afraid of that. But something like that's out of my control, so why bother worrying about it? That's why I don't!"""
st_056100_0280#0,"""That's why I'm a Queen my people can take pride in! That's what I've decided."""
st_056100_0290#0,"""There's no point worrying over what each individual person in my kingdom thinks."""
st_056100_0300#0,"""...You realize that pride is why you did something absurd like summon those four people, right?"""
st_056100_0310#0,"""Shut up! If the Queen isn't going to be the prideful one, then who is?! You agree with me at least, right?!"""
st_056100_0320#0,"""Wait, what the heck is-"""
st_056100_0330#0,"""Queen Margareta!!"""
st_056100_0340#0,"""Th-thanks... But what was that just now?! The heck did it come from?!"""
st_056100_0350#0,"""I don't know. I can only assume it sprung up from nowhere."""
st_056100_0360#0,"""A-A Devil Castle's appeared! And it's spawning demons too!"""
st_056100_0370#0,"""But how could one suddenly appear without a summoner to call it?"""
st_056100_0380#0,"""Leave it to me!"""
st_056100_0390#0,"""Stand back!"""
