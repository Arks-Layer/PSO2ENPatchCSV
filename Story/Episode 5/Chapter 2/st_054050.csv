st_054050_0030#0,"""Hey, that's harsh. We came rushing here to save you, a little appreciation would be nice!"""
st_054050_0040#0,"""Hmph... I never asked for your help."""
st_054050_0050#0,"""Gettemhart! I'm sorry, he's always like this..."""

st_054050_0070#0,"""Isn't it obvious? It's war."""
st_054050_0080#0,"""War... against which nation?"""
st_054050_0090#0,"""Not a nation. Against everything around us."""

st_054050_0170#0,"""As you just heard, we might have to dip into tomorrow's food supply. It's like this everywhere in Verun."""

st_054050_0190#0,"""Eh? Oh, hey kiddo. What's the matter, can't you say \""thanks for protecting me\""?"""
st_054050_0200#0,"""Huh, I don't remember asking you to protect me!"""
st_054050_0210#0,"""Hehe, reminds me of a certain someone."""

st_054050_0340#0,"""With the nearby Devil Castle destroyed, we should be ok for now..."""
st_054050_0350#0,"""But soon, the struggle will begin again. The only way to end it is to destroy the Emperor."""
st_054050_0360#0,"""The Devil Castles, the Demonic Soldiers... I'll destroy them all, and the Emperor too... I'll put an end to this damned country."""
st_054050_0370#0,"""He's not very honest with himself, and I know he's gruff and hard to understand, but... He wants to bring peace to this land."""
st_054050_0380#0,"""It's a civil war, is that correct? Has anyone thought of overthrowing the Emperor before?"""
st_054050_0390#0,"""Yes, of course. And the Emperor's power has overwhelmed all of them."""
st_054050_0400#0,"""The Emperor is stronger than anyone. His only desire is to fight a strong opponent. Nothing else matters."""

st_054055_0070#0,"""You have to let them swim a little longer, or else the meal will have no flavor."""
st_054055_0080#0,"""Heh... Giving orders to the Emperor now? Look how high and mighty you've become."""
