st_054135_0010#0,"""The results of your medical exam came in. There was nothing abnormal that we can see at this time."""
st_054135_0020#0,"""When I heard that you took on [Elder]'s form, I was rather nervous about that ordeal. However, seeing these numbers here have reassured my faith."""
st_054135_0030#0,"""I'm also glad to hear that you also used the Darker Factor as well."""
st_054135_0040#0,"""Well then, if we're able to analyze the mechanism, we'll be able to use it for other purposes as well, if possible..."""
st_054135_0050#0,"""That said, it's still unclear to which you've gained this new ability."""
st_054135_0060#0,"""We still don't know how either..."""
st_054135_0070#0,"""How about this... We'll just continue to monitor this new ability and let's talk about the situation regarding Omega."""
st_054135_0080#0,"""If we take the report at face value, it was mostly a solo operation that lead to the sacking of an emperor."""
st_054135_0090#0,"""And while I say this as if I'm not serious, isn't that normally a tough thing to do? Am I missing something here?"""
st_054135_0100#0,"""No, you're right Alma. Except <%me> isn't exactly normal."""
st_054135_0110#0,"""T-That's not true! <%me> is a normal person!"""
st_054135_0120#0,"""By the way Matoi, you're also not exactly normal."""
st_054135_0130#0,"""How mean! But in that case, isn't Alma..."""
st_054135_0140#0,"""I'm not very good at combat. Claris Claes however, was very good at that."""
st_054135_0150#0,"""Sealing [Elder] away on a planet isn't exactly normal either... Was that still Claris Claes?"""
st_054135_0160#0,"""Nope, that was all me. Even if we had defeated him, he'd just come back again. There was no choice but to seal him away."""
st_054135_0170#0,"""Though, because it was a sudden idea, I think we did pretty okay for that."""
st_054135_0180#0,"""So with that... We can say all of you, are far from normal."""
st_054135_0190#0,"""So with that out of the way, what's the scoop on the Black Hole since we've left?"""
st_054135_0200#0,"""The rate of the Black Hole's expansion has eased up since the time of your report."""
st_054135_0210#0,"""Yep, it's made extracting you two out easier than before."""
st_054135_0220#0,"""It's had an effect on both a mathematical and intuitive perspective."""
st_054135_0230#0,"""Alright... If we keep up the pace while we're in Omega, then I'm sure it'll get better!"""
st_054135_0240#0,"""Easy you two. While I'm sure that you're excited to keep up the good work, don't strain yourselves out there..."""
st_054135_0250#0,"""1. Is there something wrong?"""
st_054135_0260#0,"""2. You're not straining yourself either, right Matoi?"""
st_054135_0270#0,"""I'm alright, but I don't know how to put this into words... But, there's something on my mind."""
st_054135_0280#0,"""It's not from overworking myself, but there's something on my mind."""
st_054135_0290#0,"""While I'm manipulating Photons with Alma, I can feel something out there..."""
st_054135_0300#0,"""An odd feeling, something unlike everyone and Darkers. It's rather strange, it feels like I am being used in some weird way."""
st_054135_0310#0,"""Neither I, nor Xiao would know anything about that, unfortunately..."""
st_054135_0320#0,"""However, there must be something out there for Second to feel that way. Something that we cannot imagine as of yet."""
st_054135_0330#0,"""The sudden appearance of Falz Hunar was unexpected. As well as <%me> using the powers of a Dark Falz."""
st_054135_0340#0,"""Everyone, please be careful out there... If you were to be defeated, then we lose everything."""
st_054135_0350#0,"""Yes, and if you push yourselves too hard, then Second here will faint from worrying herself out."""
st_054135_0360#0,"""Ha, haha... I doubt we'd get that far."""
st_054135_0370#0,"""That said... Please be careful."""
