st_054060_0004#0,"""Hah!"""
st_054060_0008#0,"""Take this!"""
st_054060_0010#0,"""I wonder if we got everything..."""
st_054060_0020#0,"""Phew, was it just me or... Did the enemies feel really strong today..."""
st_054060_0030#0,"""Hehehe. That is probably, very likely, the answer and not just your imagination."""
st_054060_0040#0,"""Huh, Lisa?"""
st_054060_0050#0,"""Yes, it's Lisa, hello! This must have been quite the mission if it required two Guardians on a sortie together."""
st_054060_0060#0,"""Oh, we were on the Bridge together, so...<br>But never mind that. You said it wasn't just my imagination?"""
st_054060_0070#0,"""About the enemies, that is. They were, to sum it up in one word, tough. In two words, strong and tough."""
st_054060_0080#0,"""Lisa would know these things, since she shoots and shoots and shoots all kinds of Darkers."""
st_054060_0090#0,"""These ones that that just appeared were different. They were stronger, and tougher, and stranger."""
st_054060_0100#0,"""Also, also, the alarms were too slow to respond to an invasion of this extent."""
st_054060_0110#0,"""What are the chances that, now of all times, nobody was able to predict this attack?"""
st_054060_0120#0,"""Umm, Lisa... Do you know something?"""
st_054060_0130#0,"""Lisa only knows what happened. The enemy's strength was unusual, and our response was unusual too. That's all Lisa knows."""
st_054060_0140#0,"""Well, Lisa is off to find more of those strangely powerful Darkers to play with. Ehehe, hehehehehe."""
st_054060_0150#0,"""<%me>, Matoi, the situation seems to be all clear now. Could you please return to the Bridge?"""
