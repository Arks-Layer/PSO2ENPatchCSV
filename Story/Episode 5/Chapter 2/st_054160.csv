st_054160_0010#0,"""Master Harriet. Our troops are in position!"""
st_054160_0020#0,"""Thank you very much."""
st_054160_0030#0,"""To think that something such as this would happen while the Guardian was away. What great timing this was..."""
st_054160_0040#0,"""There's no need to be worried. I, the Sword Maiden, exist for this moment."""
st_054160_0050#0,"""Your hands seem to be shaking. There's no need for your bravado, Sword Maiden."""
st_054160_0060#0,"""To think that it would be during my time... I hope I never have to use this power if possible."""
st_054160_0070#0,"""However, if the time comes. I will sacrifice this body and strength to the sword."""
st_054160_0080#0,"""It sure would have been reassuring if the Guardian was here..."""
st_054160_0090#0,"""We can't use anything from what we don't have. We can wish later, it's coming now!"""
st_054160_0100#0,"""That's... That's the Crimson Evil Dragon!?"""
st_054160_0105#0,"""It's larger than a Devil Castle...!"""
st_054160_0110#0,"""Sigh, I wish you would take these apocalyptic legends more seriously."""
st_054160_0120#0,"""Phosphorescence... Quickly, raise a barrier. It's going to use its breath!"""
st_054160_0130#0,"""There's no need."""
st_054160_0140#0,"""The Sword is calling on me, to defeat and seal it away. It's telling me that this body is a vessel to complete said task."""
st_054160_0150#0,"""I will put an end to this quickly... I hope that none of you are caught in the crossfire."""
st_054160_0152#0,"""Hah!"""
st_054160_0154#0,"""Guh!"""
st_054160_0156#0,"""Haa!"""
st_054160_0160#0,"""The Crimson Evil Dragon and the Sword Maiden. They're both imperfect..."""
st_054160_0170#0,"""All of you, maintain that barrier. Even if we are leaving it to the Maiden. Do not let the Crimson Evil Dragon escape, no matter what."""
st_054160_0180#0,"""Is there something wrong, Harriet?"""
st_054160_0190#0,"""I wonder... When I look at the Evil Dragon, why doesn't my uneasiness go away?"""
st_054160_0200#0,"""Uneasiness, hmm."""
