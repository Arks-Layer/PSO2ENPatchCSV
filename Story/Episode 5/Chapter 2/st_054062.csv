st_054062_0020#0,"""But, Xiao. Those Darkers were..."""
st_054062_0030#0,"""We were gathering data here too. Looking at these readings, it's clear that the Darkers are being strengthened."""
st_054062_0040#0,"""The question is, why..."""
st_054062_0050#0,"""They're being influenced by Omega?"""
st_054062_0060#0,"""Have you thought of anything?"""
st_054062_0070#0,"""...There's no way to say for sure yet, but I can't think what else it could be."""

st_054062_0160#0,"""The situation is worse than we thought."""
st_054062_0170#0,"""The Black Hole is absorbing immense amounts of energy. Given enough time, it'll grow beyond our ability to handle."""
