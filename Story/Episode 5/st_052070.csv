st_052070_0010#0,"""Oh... the Guardian. Thank you for your assistance the other day."""
st_052070_0020#0,"""Thank you for helping Lady Harriet."""
st_052070_0030#0,"""1. It was only natural."""
st_052070_0040#0,"""2. Is something wrong?"""
st_052070_0050#0,"""I simply regret that I could not have done as you had. That... I am not strong enough to do as you had."""
st_052070_0060#0,"""Please, do not think me to complain--I am grateful.<br>I am simply... remiss. I lack the strength to act as my position should."""
st_052070_0070#0,"""It is that lack of strength that has disallowed me to assist milady in her time of need."""
st_052070_0080#0,"""I am Lady Harriet's adjutant. Perhaps, if I had the<br>strength of a Guardian, she would rely on me more."""
st_052070_0090#0,"""You are not considering the use of Ephimera... Are you?"""
st_052070_0100#0,"""The reports I've heard speak of the intoxicating allure of its power.<br>Yet, much of its power and effects remain unknown."""
st_052070_0110#0,"""Nevertheless, you needn't even abstain from its effects, need you?"""
st_052070_0120#0,"""There are those, like myself, who are burdened by their lack of combat prowess and might, yet would never dream of using Ephimera."""
st_052070_0130#0,"""It would mean... betraying the ideals by which we stand behind Milady."""
st_052070_0140#0,"""Ephimera is dangerous, and will drive the world into ruin.<br>It would be foolish to delude oneself into believing otherwise."""
st_052070_0150#0,"""Lady Harriet... has been fighting for everyone's sake. That... is irrefutable."""
st_052070_0160#0,"""To defeat Lutz, who has forsaken his own people in a mad lust for the power to achieve his own selfish desires..."""
st_052070_0170#0,"""...No matter the pain or terror in her way, she pushes through, and relentlessly forges on."""
st_052070_0180#0,"""I--No, everyone--is finding their own ways to offer their support."""
st_052070_0190#0,"""Guardian... Again, from the bottom of my heart, I thank you for helping Lady Harriet."""
st_052070_0200#0,"""But as her adjutant, it is my job to protect her!"""
st_052070_0210#0,"""If you will excuse me."""
st_052070_0220#0,"""He's so honest! He must really admire Harriet."""
st_052070_0230#0,"""Well, we successfully got some more information."""
st_052070_0240#0,"""Driven more by Harriet's inspiring spirit rather than solely to destroy the effects Ephimera's had on their lands, huh?"""
st_052070_0250#0,"""I'm quite charmed myself! Such dignity and poise...<br>She must have been raised by a wonderful family!<br>What do you think they're like?"""
