un_057020_0010#0,"""Oho, it's the Guardians. What are you two loitering around here for?"""
un_057020_0020#0,"""Oh, Maria. Good day."""
un_057020_0030#0,"""Hmph, nice to see some respect. The little urchins I teach could learn a thing or two from you."""
un_057020_0040#0,"""Although, Regius and I aren't much for formality while teaching either. Hahahah!"""
un_057020_0050#0,"""You're the Commander of General Affairs, aren't you? Why are you helping the Instruction Sector?"""
un_057020_0060#0,"""Hm? Because it's more interesting."""
un_057020_0070#0,"""The General Affairs position was supposed to go to Regius originally, but it ended up in my lap after he turned it down. So I don't care if anyone makes a fuss."""
un_057020_0080#0,"""Umm, but won't that cause problems for General Affairs if they don't have a Commander...?"""
un_057020_0090#0,"""They're better off without me around. Besides, Matoi, haven't you been lending a hand here and there?"""
un_057020_0100#0,"""It's more like my hand's taken, rather than being lent..."""
un_057020_0110#0,"""Are you sure it's okay to leave everything to others?"""
un_057020_0120#0,"""It's a burden for Matoi"""
un_057020_0130#0,"""It's not like I'm leaving the work to just anyone."""
un_057020_0140#0,"""You're so direct...! I mean, it isn't like that! It's not really that much of a bother!"""
un_057020_0150#0,"""Hmmm. Then there's no problem now, is there?"""
un_057020_0160#0,"""If there were, you can take it up with Sara for dragging you along. I'm not forcing you into anything."""
un_057020_0170#0,"""I know she can handle it, so I let her."""
un_057020_0180#0,"""Regius and I will have to step back from the limelight soon enough. Our time to resign is coming."""
un_057020_0190#0,"""Don't forget that we're both soldiers, too. It wouldn't be unusual if one day we just weren't around anymore."""
un_057020_0200#0,"""To keep the chain of command from falling into chaos when that time comes, we need people who can take the lead now."""
un_057020_0210#0,"""I can't speak for the Information Sector, but Zeno and that young girl at his side can handle the Instruction Sector."""
un_057020_0220#0,"""Simply put, I do it so the next generation will be ready."""
un_057020_0230#0,"""What a touching sentiment. You just wanna play hooky, don't you?"""
un_057020_0240#0,"""Ah, Sara."""
un_057020_0250#0,"""What's this? Is the General Affairs Deputy unappreciative of her Commander trying to look out for her future?"""
un_057020_0260#0,"""Just how far into the future are we talking about here? You retiring, I mean."""
un_057020_0270#0,"""...Not long at all now. To be honest, Regius and I have been at the forefront for far too long."""
un_057020_0280#0,"""Huh...?"""
un_057020_0290#0,"""What's wrong? Don't make such a long face. Or do you not want me to retire?"""
un_057020_0300#0,"""W-What makes you think I wouldn't! If you're going to do it then hurry up already! Go live out the rest of your days in peace, you old hag!"""
un_057020_0310#0,"""Hahah, that's not much of a threat now is it?"""
un_057020_0320#0,"""Maria, are you really..."""
un_057020_0330#0,"""Hm? Oh, the future isn't here just yet."""
un_057020_0340#0,"""But it's still a fact that we're getting old. In the not-so-distant future, Regius and I will probably leave ARKS."""
un_057020_0350#0,"""That's why we're shaping ARKS into a bastion of unwavering solidarity. It's our duty, after all."""
un_057020_0360#0,"""To protect the ARKS organization. To protect the place everyone calls home."""
un_057020_0370#0,"""It's the biggest pain in my rear there could be...but we made a promise to Alma."""
un_057020_0380#0,"""A promise to Alma..."""
un_057020_0390#0,"""Pah, I'm just rambling now. Don't worry about that, forget I said anything."""
un_057020_0400#0,"""Well now, I suppose I should show up to one of those Commander meetings once in a while and act the part. Take care, you two."""
