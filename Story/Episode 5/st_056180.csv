st_056180_0020#0,"""Two leaders remained. Moreover, they<br>would undoubtedly be familiar faces."""
st_056180_0030#0,"""Just how formidable of foes might they be...<br>And what form would they take?"""
st_056180_0040#0,"""Tormented by this two-fold dread, they continued<br>onward toward the Southern Fortress."""
st_056180_0050#0,"""However, what awaited them there was<br>something unimaginably twisted from the truth."""
st_056180_0060#0,"""...I suppose you deserve some praise for making it this far."""
st_056180_0070#0,"""This one has a completely different aura from the rest..."""
st_056180_0080#0,"""Hmph... Don't try to compare me to those others. Their experience pales against mine."""
st_056180_0090#0,"""...The wind is calling. It's beckoning you to the afterlife."""
st_056180_0100#0,"""This really is awful... I wonder what would Afin think, if he saw her like this..."""

st_056180_0120#0,"""...Her reaction! Don't tell me, she's under<br>someone's control?!"""
st_056180_0130#0,"""Why're you acting like you're some third party in all of this! It was your wish that caused it!"""
st_056180_0140#0,"""Oh dear, Yu. Could it be you're struggling, after putting on such a tough act?"""
st_056180_0150#0,"""Tch...Shut up! What did you come here for, Aurora the Meek?"""
st_056180_0160#0,"""I came out of concern for my fellow Infernal Guardian. There's no need to be so callous, Yucreta the Obstinate."""
st_056180_0170#0,"""Besides, they've probably grown bored of how things have been playing out, so I decided I would support you!"""
st_056180_0180#0,"""Those two seem way too comfortable doing this!"""
st_056180_0190#0,"""With me here we're nigh unstoppable! Yu, let's finish this in one fell swoop!"""
st_056180_0200#0,"""I was going to!"""
st_056180_0210#0,"""Enchanting Radiant Dance, Aurora!"""
st_056180_0220#0,"""She's even using her Genesis Weapon?! T-This whole thing is absurd, but they're totally serious!"""

st_056180_0310#0,"""You don't have time to be getting distracted!"""
st_056180_0320#0,"""You're not half bad. You did defeat the others after all."""

st_056180_0340#0,"""Ye...YEOWCH!"""
st_056180_0350#0,"""W-W-W-What the heck! That really hurt! Am I dreaming? Was that all a dream?!"""
st_056180_0360#0,"""Aurora...What are you talking about? We're in the middle of battle, change back already."""
st_056180_0370#0,"""No way, that hurt like heck...Wait, what's with that getup, Yu?! Did you turn back into a Dark Falz?!"""
st_056180_0380#0,"""Aurora turned back to normal...? Wait, could<br><%me>'s power have done it...?"""

st_056180_0400#0,"""Guh...! What is..."""
st_056180_0410#0,"""...What's going on? Why am I out here? Did you do something, Aurora?"""
st_056180_0420#0,"""How should I know? It felt like I was having a crazy long dream, but then something hurt real bad and I woke up."""
st_056180_0430#0,"""But, if this isn't a dream then... Just where the heck are we?"""
st_056180_0440#0,"""Thank goodness! You two have both turned back to normal."""
st_056180_0450#0,"""...You're...Xiera? Why do you look like that? And back to normal? Were we being controlled?"""
st_056180_0460#0,"""Well, you see... It'd take a while to explain everything that's happened..."""
st_056180_0470#0,"""...Huh? No battle? You've won her over? No more excitement?"""
st_056180_0480#0,"""...You can fight her yourself if you really wanna make it more exciting."""
st_056180_0490#0,"""W-Well, solving our problems without violence is perfect! It's great that they've turned back to normal! If there's no fight, that's alright! Yup!"""
st_056180_0500#0,"""...Who's that moronic-looking girl over there?"""
st_056180_0510#0,"""What?! Insolence, insolence! Such incredible insolence! And you call me moronic of all things! That is the word I hate the most!"""
st_056180_0520#0,"""Oho, you know a big word like 'insolence.' What a smart kid."""
st_056180_0530#0,"""Your condescension is infuriatingly insolent!<br>You're even shorter than me, are you not? Insolent brat!"""
st_056180_0540#0,"""Huuuuuh?! Compared to a paragon of magnificent beauty such as myself, you are the brat!"""
st_056180_0550#0,"""What was that?! Are you picking a fight with a Divine Queen?!"""
st_056180_0560#0,"""Hah! I don't have a clue what a Divine Queen is, but you're face-to-face with the goddess of good-looks! A real-life deity!"""
st_056180_0570#0,"""Oof!"""
st_056180_0575#0,"""Ow!"""
st_056180_0580#0,"""Striking a queen is the very embodiment of insolence...!"""
st_056180_0590#0,"""It's bad enough that I have to listen to one of you, don't make me suffer through two of you squawking at each other."""
