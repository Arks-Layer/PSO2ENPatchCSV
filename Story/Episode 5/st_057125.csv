st_057120_0020#0,"""Hehe, ahaha, ahahahah! You really are amazing, Guardian! This is the most fun I've had yet!"""
st_057120_0030#0,"""To think having someone to play with would feel this refreshing...! It's the first time I've felt like this!"""
st_057120_0040#0,"""You have to stop."""
st_057120_0050#0,"""What's the point of all this fighting?"""
st_057120_0060#0,"""Why do we need to stop? Do we need a reason to fight? Do we need a reason to play?"""
st_057120_0070#0,"""Then tell me, Guardian. What reason was there for making me be all alone?"""
st_057120_0080#0,"""Why did I have to be locked up all by myself all the time?"""
st_057120_0090#0,"""I want to meet people, I want to be near people. I want someone to talk with, someone to argue with."""
st_057120_0100#0,"""I want friends, I want... I want I want I want I want I want I want I want I want I want I want I want I want I want!"""
st_057120_0110#0,"""That's why I made friends... That's why I was chosen... To use my power when I was told..."""
st_057120_0120#0,"""But I'm not... I'm not a guinea pig... I'm Flo... I'm..."""
st_057120_0130#0,"""Flo, what's going on...?"""
st_057120_0140#0,"""...His memories are clouded. That is Flo, yet it is not Flo. The original's memories have become mixed with his."""
st_057120_0150#0,"""...Huh? Clarissa?"""
st_057120_0160#0,"""[Double] was born from loneliness. Can you rescue him from it?"""
st_057120_0170#0,"""...I'll try."""
st_057120_0180#0,"""Of course."""
st_057120_0190#0,"""...Then allow me to guide you. So that you may save him."""
st_057120_0200#0,"""Clarissa?"""
st_057120_0210#0,"""Flo... It's time to stop. We were wrong."""
st_057120_0220#0,"""Wrong? But I haven't done anything wrong. See? Just look at all of the friends I have to keep me company!"""
st_057120_0230#0,"""...Clarissa?"""
st_057120_0240#0,"""Back then, and even now, it was a failure on our part to turn a blind eye to your loneliness."""
st_057120_0250#0,"""No matter how great a power you had, you were still just a child. Always alone. The fault lies with those of us who forgot that."""
st_057120_0260#0,"""The child who knew only destruction is no more. The time to end this has come."""
st_057120_0270#0,"""...You're not making any sense, Clarissa."""
st_057120_0280#0,"""So, why? Why do I feel so sad?"""
st_057120_0290#0,"""Because it's all over now."""
st_057120_0300#0,"""But... I... I don't... I don't wanna be alone... I don't wanna!"""
st_057120_0310#0,"""...Please set Flo free."""
st_057120_0320#0,"""...Yeah, it did happen. Of course it happened."""
st_057120_0330#0,"""Aww, that was so boring. I had to remember something so boring. Wish I could have forgotten all about it and just played all day."""
st_057120_0340#0,"""Are you...Flo?"""
st_057120_0350#0,"""...[Double]?"""
st_057120_0360#0,"""Do you really need to ask at this point? I'm Flo, and I'm [Double]. To prove it..."""
st_057120_0370#0,"""Look! Did I scare you? Did I surprise you?"""
st_057120_0380#0,"""My name is Frau. I made me out of myself."""
st_057120_0390#0,"""Although, neither of us cares which is which. Because it doesn't matter at all."""
st_057120_0400#0,"""Yup. It really doesn't matter who's who."""
st_057120_0410#0,"""And we don't care about being used, or what happened to us."""
st_057120_0420#0,"""Because we've been alive for a loooong time."""
st_057120_0430#0,"""Because we've been kept alive for a long time."""
st_057120_0440#0,"""But that's fine. All of it's fine. 'Cause<br>everything's fine as long as we get to have fun."""
st_057120_0450#0,"""...That's why right now is no fun at all. Because there's a jerk out there who used us."""
st_057120_0460#0,"""Someone with a really nasty smell. Almost like the weird smell you have."""
st_057120_0470#0,"""A lot of our power was taken by him."""
st_057120_0480#0,"""That's why we're gonna share what's left with you, so you can stop him. Sounds like a pretty good deal, huh?"""
st_057120_0490#0,"""If you can do it... If you can make him go away, then all the fighting should stop."""
st_057120_0500#0,"""Why do you want that?"""
st_057120_0510#0,"""What are you after?"""
st_057120_0520#0,"""I am Flo. The original [Double]. My wish has always been for one thing."""
st_057120_0530#0,"""To create a world without conflict, that everyone can play together in."""
st_057120_0540#0,"""...Come on! Please hang in there!"""
st_057120_0550#0,"""...<%me>! Thank goodness you're awake! I was so worried!"""
st_057120_0560#0,"""Where's Flo...?"""
st_057120_0570#0,"""Is everything gone...?"""
st_057120_0580#0,"""Flo is... He disappeared while Clarissa was hugging him. So did all of the things he created..."""
st_057120_0590#0,"""<%me>... Did you talk to him?"""
st_057120_0600#0,"""...Someone who used Flo. That's gotta be Elmir."""
st_057120_0610#0,"""I'm not picking up any readings around here... Where could he be hiding?"""
st_057120_0620#0,"""Either way, the Demon armies should have stopped regenerating. Let's go meet back up with Harriet."""
