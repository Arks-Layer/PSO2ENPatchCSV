st_054080_0010#0,"""As Gettemhart, the Guardian and the others move<br>through Verun, they defeat each Devil Castle<br>along the way."""
st_054080_0020#0,"""The Devil Castles were originally a skill from Cuent.<br>However, many identical Devil Castles were found<br>scattered across Verun."""
st_054080_0030#0,"""The Devil Castles were spread deeper than originally thought.<br>The Guardian had raised a question in relation to their history."""
st_054080_0040#0,"""Despite being from Cuent, there sure a lot of Devil Castles here in Verun."""
st_054080_0050#0,"""When they were brought over, they were spread throughout the nation, under the authority of the Emperor."""
st_054080_0060#0,"""Hmm. Then the Emperor of Verun must be well-versed with the knowledge of Magic."""
st_054080_0070#0,"""Of course, he became the Emperor through the power of Demonization. Although, while he can perform Magic..."""
st_054080_0080#0,"""It was not he, who summoned the Devil Castles... That, was Elmir."""
st_054080_0090#0,"""Elmir? Who's that?"""
st_054080_0100#0,"""That damned Emperor's brother. He's always in close proximity of the Emperor, always with a self-absorbed smug look on his face."""
st_054080_0110#0,"""But with the age gap between them, they might as well be father and son with their looks."""
st_054080_0120#0,"""The Emperor and Elmir... There's no mistake about it, they're definitely behind Verun's demise."""
st_054080_0130#0,"""Behind its demise? Well, excuse me. All we did was rally the citizens of this simpleminded nation."""
st_054080_0140#0,"""Elmir!? Why are you here...!?"""
st_054080_0150#0,"""I've heard that someone here destroyed my beloved Devil Castles. So I decided to, investigate."""
st_054080_0160#0,"""So, I came to see you. The Savior of Cuent, the Guardian."""
st_054080_0170#0,"""I see, I see... I feel, unlimited potential. It's no wonder why you defeated a Devil Castle."""
st_054080_0180#0,"""From Devil Castles to Guardians; Cuent sure knows fine craftsmanship."""
st_054080_0190#0,"""You must have some nerve, brazenly waltzing in here, the Emperor's kid brother...!"""
st_054080_0200#0,"""Really, such a tiresome chap you are. I am not interested in your rabble, failed experiment. So would you kindly stop standing in the way?"""
st_054080_0210#0,"""Even if you deny it, we have business to deal with you!"""
st_054080_0220#0,"""What!?"""
st_054080_0230#0,"""If you wish to fight so much, then punch away like the failed Demon Soldiers you are."""
st_054080_0240#0,"""No, it can't be... These people are... I thought they were all... dead?"""
st_054080_0250#0,"""As expected, they're from the same identical experiment. After all, they're a Devil Castle and Demonic Soldier hybrid."""
st_054080_0260#0,"""You replaced the Demons summoned by the Devil Castle with these... soldiers!?"""
st_054080_0270#0,"""Exactly. The components we needed just happened to be scattered around."""
st_054080_0280#0,"""While they all had very questionable abilities, but as soldiers, they're not bad."""
st_054080_0290#0,"""With that being said, it would be a waste if we did not use them effectively. That would be so sad, wouldn't it?"""
st_054080_0300#0,"""How repulsive...!"""
st_054080_0310#0,"""Ha, haha, Haahaahaa!!"""
st_054080_0320#0,"""STOP SCREWING WITH ME! YOU DAMNED FREAK! TOYING WITH US ENDLESSLY, NONSTOP!"""
st_054080_0330#0,"""I'LL KILL YOU...! AND THAT DAMNED EMPEROR BROTHER OF YOURS!"""
st_054080_0340#0,"""Oh yes, what a fine spirit... Then you should come over by stepping on the corpses of your friends."""
