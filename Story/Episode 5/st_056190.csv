st_056190_0010#0,"""...Hmm. So the four people with ties to [Apprentice] were all summoned here, huh?"""
st_056190_0020#0,"""I wouldn't believe you if you told me a place like this existed, but...having experienced it firsthand, I guess I'll have to."""
st_056190_0030#0,"""...So then, if she was able to summon us, who exactly is that stuck-up girl?"""
st_056190_0040#0,"""I was certain she was Aurora, or someone closely connected to her, but..."""
st_056190_0050#0,"""Well, I was the original [Apprentice] after all, so with things being as they are, I can see why<br>you'd come to that conclusion."""
st_056190_0060#0,"""But she's clearly not me. And of course, I don't know anyone as dim-witted as Miss Moron here."""
st_056190_0070#0,"""Argh, you said it again! How long will it take before you learn your place, you moron?!"""
st_056190_0080#0,"""Shut up already, would you?! If nobody ever calls a moron a moron, they'll never figure it out!<br>So I'm calling you a moron!"""
st_056190_0090#0,"""...If you ask me, they could pass for identical<br>twins."""
st_056190_0100#0,"""It's like how the same magnetic poles repel each other. They were both chosen by [Apprentice], so their personalities would have to be pretty similar."""
st_056190_0110#0,"""By the way, is there any way for us to get back to the ARKS Ship from here?"""
st_056190_0120#0,"""Ah...of course. When the others were defeated and freed, they returned to our world..."""
st_056190_0130#0,"""Whaaat? You mean we've gotta suffer even more? Why should we have to go through that?"""
st_056190_0140#0,"""I seem to remember a certain someone saying \""those who suffer will be saved\"" once before."""
st_056190_0150#0,"""Shut up, Yu! ...Hey, Divine Moron! You summoned us, do something about this."""
st_056190_0160#0,"""I-I don't know how to unsummon someone!<br>In fact, I hardly even know how I was able to summon you in the first place!"""
st_056190_0170#0,"""Don't take that tone with me!"""
st_056190_0180#0,"""N-now, now, there's no need to fight, you two."""
st_056190_0190#0,"""If something was brought here through summoning arts, it should be possible to return what was summoned by making use of the same magic circle in the same location that the summoning took place."""
st_056190_0200#0,"""Ah! In that case, we're headed to the royal palace! Let's not dally! I have to call off the evacuation order too!"""
