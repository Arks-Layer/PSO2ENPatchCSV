st_052110_0010#0,"""So the origin of the problem lies<br>within this flower... \""Ephimera\""."""
st_052110_0020#0,"""Have you heard about the potency of this flower?"""
st_052110_0030#0,"""Using it as a magical catalyst drastically improves the magical effect..."""
st_052110_0040#0,"""Yes, indeed. Especially if used to<br>perform magic that was regarded as<br>impossible for normal people."""
st_052110_0050#0,"""It's a mysterious and peculiar flower that disappears like a mist when its petals fall off, and blooms unexpectedly without ever producing seeds."""
st_052110_0060#0,"""It was also described as a gift from God... But of course, it's the opposite."""
st_052110_0070#0,"""It's a magical flower that slowly consumes the soul of its user upon each use and alters the world. It's more akin to a contract with a demon."""
st_052110_0080#0,"""Consumes the soul...?<br>What does that even mean?"""
st_052110_0090#0,"""I've already explained it, fairy. If you use the Mana that Ephimera uses, your soul will be consumed over time."""
st_052110_0100#0,"""If you use magic while using Ephimera, it will unconsciously progress... to a point where the distinction between reality and fantasy is lost. Total insanity."""
st_052110_0110#0,"""It only allows for itself. It will make you incapable of thinking about others."""
st_052110_0120#0,"""Lutz also became insane... he killed the king and took over the throne. And so, here we are."""
st_052110_0130#0,"""This is just like a Darker infection..."""
st_052110_0140#0,"""However, it's starting to sound like the origin of Ephimera is the [Profound Darkness]."""
st_052110_0150#0,"""If you continue to use Ephimera, your soul is consumed... If that's the case, then it's definitely a threat."""
st_052110_0160#0,"""But how did you figure this out?"""
st_052110_0170#0,"""That's..."""
st_052110_0180#0,"""I was the person responsible for creating the magic that summons a Devil Castle. I've killed many who've gone insane from it."""
st_052110_0190#0,"""No, that was different! My brother only did it for the development of magic...!"""
st_052110_0200#0,"""It's alright, Harriet."""
st_052110_0210#0,"""We sacrificed many in the pursuit of research and development. It was my sin, and it was what cost me the throne."""
st_052110_0220#0,"""And because of me, the world is being consumed by my research. That is a fact."""
st_052110_0230#0,"""1. Why did you do this?"""
st_052110_0240#0,"""2. Did it not go according to plan?"""
st_052110_0250#0,"""Would you trust me if I said it was for advancing the world...?"""
st_052110_0260#0,"""It was a subject for studying. Isn't that alone enough of a reason to continue the research?"""
st_052110_0270#0,"""If it did, you think I would be in this place?"""
st_052110_0280#0,"""This is the result of sticking to my research and not looking at others."""
st_052110_0290#0,"""As people's souls were being consumed, I only sat there and watched."""
st_052110_0300#0,"""Had Harriet not been there, I would have ended up the same as Lutz..."""
st_052110_0310#0,"""It's true, my brother created the Devil Castles..."""
st_052110_0320#0,"""But it was also my brother, Luther, who created the summoning technique, \""Buster Tower\"" that is used to destroy the castles."""
st_052110_0330#0,"""However, it's because of this research that Lutz set out to have us killed."""
st_052110_0340#0,"""Starting with the sharing of the<br>Devil Castle technology to other<br>nations, spreading lies and rumors,<br>and research that further ruins this<br>nation; I wonder how many false<br>charges he's gotten lined up now?"""
st_052110_0350#0,"""Ephimera was discovered decades before we were born."""
st_052110_0360#0,"""Although its effect was huge, it wasn't enough to change the world."""
st_052110_0370#0,"""However, the new summoning method that what my brother, Luther, discovered, the Devil Castles, changed the way war was fought in this world."""
st_052110_0380#0,"""Each nation has summoned a Devil Castle along their borders and created a situation where no one can attack, only keep on posturing."""
st_052110_0390#0,"""We cannot attack, but the battle will not spread; No unneeded bloodshed either. It almost makes the world peaceful."""
st_052110_0400#0,"""I guess you could say that the widespread knowledge on Devil Castles hasn't gone in vain."""
st_052110_0410#0,"""However, this is only the first step towards global destruction."""
st_052110_0420#0,"""Because Ephimera will drive people insane?"""
st_052110_0430#0,"""Yes, we must destroy all of the Devil Castles, as they consume and spread Ephimera."""
st_052110_0440#0,"""For that reason, I created the Buster Towers as a way to break through the Devil Castle's Devil Barrier."""
st_052110_0450#0,"""Of course, just using it requires a ton of Mana. Of course, without Ephimera..."""
st_052110_0460#0,"""It's not something an ordinary person can utilize. It was impossible for Harriet and I as well."""
st_052110_0470#0,"""However, you seem to have mastered it and mastered destroying the Devil Barriers and Devil Castle as well."""
st_052110_0475#0,"""In addition, you've analyzed a Buster Tower with your own technology and even replicated it. Several, even."""
st_052110_0480#0,"""What can we call you, if not saviors?"""
st_052110_0490#0,"""Blooming without any explanation,<br>becoming a catalyst without any<br>reason. Such fantasy doesn't exist..."""
st_052110_0500#0,"""That flower corrupts the world each time it's used, that existence that drives the world mad. We must destroy it as soon as possible."""
st_052110_0510#0,"""Luther..."""
