st_054170_0002#0,"""Hah!"""
st_054170_0004#0,"""甘い！"""
st_054170_0006#0,"""今！"""
st_054170_0010#0,"""Crimson Evil Dragon, it's over. You do not belong here. Now sleep, sleep beneath this earth."""
st_054170_0020#0,"""How impressive of you, Sword Maiden. Of course the Crimson Evil Dragon is no match against its natural adversary."""
st_054170_0030#0,"""That is of course, under normal circumstances that is..."""
st_054170_0040#0,"""There lies together with Ephimera. One who fell beneath this castle, who sought power and fame."""
st_054170_0050#0,"""His desires, his anger, and his soul! I wonder what would happen if he's used as the host?"""
st_054170_0060#0,"""Alisa, look out!"""
st_054170_0070#0,"""Wha--!?"""
st_054170_0080#0,"""Agh!"""
st_054170_0090#0,"""The sword's seal... isn't working? There's another power?"""
st_054170_0100#0,"""Sword Maiden... You traitor... """
st_054170_0110#0,"""This, this voice... it's..."""
st_054170_0120#0,"""Lutz! You mean to tell me he put his soul within the Crimson Evil Dragon!?"""
st_054170_0130#0,"""Ahh... Harriet... Luther...<br>Unacceptable, unacceptable..."""
st_054170_0140#0,"""All who had opposed me...<br>With this power... Destroy them all..."""
st_054170_0150#0,"""Guardian! You've come back!"""
st_054170_0160#0,"""Ahh... Guardian!<br>You too... I will destroy you..."""
st_054170_0170#0,"""This is... the Crimson Evil Dragon? But this feels..."""
st_054170_0180#0,"""So you've noticed too, fairy... Lutz's soul resides from within it, with the help from Ephimera."""
st_054170_0190#0,"""While the Sword Maiden's power seals away the Crimson Evil Dragon's power, Ephimera's power is different. That is why she could not fully seal it..."""
st_054170_0200#0,"""A fusion between a being that seeks to destroy the world and one that destroyed the world in the past... How extravagant."""
st_054170_0210#0,"""What are we supposed to do, if we cannot seal it just yet?"""
st_054170_0220#0,"""There's no choice, but to defeat it... If we slice its body into pieces... even if it's the Crimson Evil Dragon..."""
st_054170_0230#0,"""And for the sake of my uncle's soul... Ugh..."""
st_054170_0240#0,"""1. Don't push yourself."""
st_054170_0250#0,"""2. Leave it to me."""
st_054170_0260#0,"""However, if I'm not the one to seal it away, it would be disgraceful to my uncle..."""
st_054170_0270#0,"""Listen to me Guardian and the Sword Maiden."""
st_054170_0280#0,"""There is a way to separate Ephimera from him..."""
st_054170_0290#0,"""Big brother, please no..."""
st_054170_0300#0,"""Guardian, slow down the Evil Dragon. Sword Maiden, prepare your seal and lend us your support. If we get that far, the rest will fall on me..."""
st_054170_0310#0,"""What are you planning to do?"""
st_054170_0320#0,"""Only what a specialist with Ephimera can do."""
st_054170_0330#0,"""There's no time for questions. Move!"""
st_054170_0340#0,"""Guardian, please move away!"""
st_054170_0350#0,"""Sword... Become the chain of light to destroy the calamity and bind this squirming evil! Bindwa!"""
st_054170_0360#0,"""It's no good... This power is different from the Evil Dragon's, it's resisting the bind..."""
st_054170_0370#0,"""The restoration of a body through summoning and attaching a soul..."""
st_054170_0380#0,"""What an absurd thing you've done... This is what I've discovered... And the research I've thrown away!"""
st_054170_0400#0,"""The place where you should attach yourself is right here! Not within the Crimson Evil Dragon!"""
st_054170_0410#0,"""I don't know who or where you are, but enough with this. The only one who can use that is me... and me alone!"""
st_054170_0420#0,"""The one to use... The one to use it on... is not there!"""
st_054170_0430#0,"""Brother!"""
st_054170_0440#0,"""Was it, successful?"""
st_054170_0450#0,"""No... The sword says the seal was not perfect. With this, it is only temporary."""
st_054170_0460#0,"""Without an end, the Crimson Evil Dragon will appear once more."""
st_054170_0470#0,"""And when that time comes, I must defeat it and free my uncle's soul... This is too much..."""
st_054170_0480#0,"""Kuh..."""
st_054170_0490#0,"""Brother!"""
st_054170_0500#0,"""Harriet... I'm fine, do not worry about me."""
st_054170_0510#0,"""Luther, what did you just do?"""
st_054170_0520#0,"""I held it back by interfering with its method of infinite revival through summoning. Only the power of the Evil Dragon remains."""
st_054170_0530#0,"""Also, an enchantment technique using Ephimera was cast upon it... If you don't fight it with caution, it will get the better of you."""
st_054170_0540#0,"""To agree without hesitation... I see why you're called Guardian."""
st_054170_0550#0,"""I'm tired now... I'll be taking a short rest now."""
name01#0,"""Crimson Dragon (Lutz)"""
