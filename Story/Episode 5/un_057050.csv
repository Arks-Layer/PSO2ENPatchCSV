un_057050_0030#0,"""Yo, <%me>. What are we doing? We're giving everyone the good news."""
un_057050_0040#0,"""We just let Afin and Matoi know a little while ago."""
un_057050_0050#0,"""Thought their jaws would hit the floor, but they didn't seem all that surprised."""
un_057050_0060#0,"""They did give us their blessing."""
un_057050_0070#0,"""It's easy enough to just go right up and tell people you're buds with..."""
un_057050_0080#0,"""But how are we supposed to tell her?"""
un_057050_0090#0,"""Even though she calls herself Melrondia now, that doesn't mean everything she's done just disappeared..."""
un_057050_0100#0,"""But we can't just ignore her, it'll be awkward when she ends up hearing about it from other people... What a mess."""
un_057050_0110#0,"""You'll just have to suck it up and tell her. Don't be a coward, it won't be that bad."""
