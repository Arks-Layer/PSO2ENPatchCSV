st_053080_0010#0,"""We're experiencing no issues taking control of the Cuentian Army."""
st_053080_0020#0,"""There have been some deserters, who now operate as common mercenaries or bandits, but they number only a few."""
st_053080_0030#0,"""However, there are still Devil Castles within our domain. They persist even if their summoner should perish."""
st_053080_0040#0,"""They will not disappear on their own, and so we must continue to destroy them."""
st_053080_0050#0,"""Guardian, I realise this places a great burden on you... But I must formally request your assistance."""
st_053080_0060#0,"""1. Leave it to me."""
st_053080_0070#0,"""2. It's no easy task on your own."""
st_053080_0080#0,"""I would gladly help you, if only I were able to use the Buster Tower..."""
st_053080_0090#0,"""Indeed, I must agree."""
st_053080_0100#0,"""We are searching for anyone else who can use the Buster Tower, but as yet we have found no one. Of course, that is to be expected."""
st_053080_0110#0,"""To destroy a Devil Castle created with Ephimera, one would need power equal to that of Ephimera."""
st_053080_0120#0,"""But you, Guardian, can use the Buster Towers without the aid of Ephimera. Your power already rivals Ephimera's."""
st_053080_0130#0,"""Hmm... I don't like the way you said that."""
st_053080_0140#0,"""I did not mean to imply anything by it. I was merely stating the facts. If you perceive anything more in what I said, surely that reflects more on you than on I?"""
st_053080_0150#0,"""You've got a comeback for everything, haven't you... Why don't you try giving <%me> a little thanks once in a while?"""
st_053080_0160#0,"""I show my appreciation by not doubting a single part of your experiences... Is that not to your liking, fairy?"""
st_053080_0170#0,"""Enough!"""
st_053080_0180#0,"""Regarding those who followed Lutz, we've been carrying out checks to try and determine their reasons, but so far we've found nothing particularly concerning."""
st_053080_0190#0,"""In fact, most of them welcome Harriet's coronation and ascendancy to the throne."""
st_053080_0200#0,"""My uncle viewed everything by his own exacting standards, and would often make unreasonable demands, so naturally there was some resentment..."""
st_053080_0210#0,"""So, you're saying that everyone has accepted Harriet's revolution?"""
st_053080_0220#0,"""No, I doubt that is the only reason. In the end, it became a battle for the throne, so it is likely they are simply following the winner."""
st_053080_0230#0,"""Cuent is not monolithic. Lutz was not the only one who benefited from the power of Ephimera."""
st_053080_0240#0,"""These people may pretend to follow us, but will secretly be waiting for any opportunity to sabotage all we have accomplished."""
st_053080_0250#0,"""That is why we must remain vigilant."""
st_053080_0260#0,"""Thank you for your report. Please continue to report on this matter."""
