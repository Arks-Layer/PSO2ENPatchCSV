st_053080_0020#0,"""Quite a handful have left to become lowly mercenaries or joined opposing splinter factions."""
st_053080_0030#0,"""However, there are Devil Castles still within our domain. They will still remain even if the person who summoned it perished."""
st_053080_0040#0,"""It's a weapon that won't disappear over time, it must be destroyed."""
st_053080_0050#0,"""Although this places a burden on the Guardians, I formally request your assistance..."""
st_053080_0060#0,"""1. Leave it to me."""
st_053080_0070#0,"""2. It's no easy task on your own."""
st_053080_0080#0,"""I would help out, if I was able to use the Buster Tower..."""
st_053080_0090#0,"""Exactly, I agree."""
st_053080_0100#0,"""We were trying to find people who were able to use the Buster Tower. Of course, it's only natural that we found no one who can."""
st_053080_0110#0,"""To take down a Devil Castle, one would need power that is equal to Ephimera."""
st_053080_0120#0,"""The power of the Guardian is capable of moving the Buster Tower without the use of Ephimera. It is already beyond that of the power of Ephimera."""
st_053080_0130#0,"""Hmm... The way you say it gives off a deceptive tone."""
st_053080_0140#0,"""I did not mean anything by that. I only stated the facts. If it sounds as if I'm being deceptive, then perhaps you're feeling uneasy about something?"""
st_053080_0150#0,"""Ah, another retort... Why don't you try giving <%me> a little thanks once in a while?"""
st_053080_0160#0,"""I showed my appreciation by not doubting a single part of your experiences... Was it not up to your tastes, fairy?"""
st_053080_0170#0,"""I had enough!"""
st_053080_0180#0,"""We've also conducted surveys to those who served under Lutz, to figure their motives, but found no foul intentions."""
st_053080_0190#0,"""The general populous in turn, welcome's Harriet's coronation and ascendancy to the throne."""
st_053080_0200#0,"""My uncle would often say things according to his own criteria and would often make unreasonable demands due to the rebellion..."""
st_053080_0210#0,"""In other words, everyone accepted Harriet's revolution?"""
st_053080_0220#0,"""No, I'm sure that isn't the only reason. It became a fight for the throne in the end, so they were likely following the winner of the outcome."""
st_053080_0230#0,"""Cuent is not monolithic. In addition to Lutz, there were others who benefited from power of Ephimera."""
st_053080_0240#0,"""Those who agree with our way of thinking by word of mouth and not in their hearts, will wait for the opportunity to strike."""
st_053080_0250#0,"""That is why we must stay vigilant."""
