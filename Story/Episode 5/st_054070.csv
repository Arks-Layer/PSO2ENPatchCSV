st_054070_0010#0,"""Gettemhart and Melphonsina,<br>citizens of Verun,<br>decided to travel with the Guardian."""
st_054070_0020#0,"""Despite their party's numbers, not a<br>single word was uttered along the way."""
st_054070_0030#0,"""Umm, Gettemhart. Is there anything you want to talk about while we rest?"""
st_054070_0040#0,"""Hah, don't make me laugh. There's nothing to say."""
st_054070_0050#0,"""Hey, Gettemhart!"""
st_054070_0055#0,"""Please excuse him, I know he comes off as rude."""
st_054070_0060#0,"""No, it's fine. I don't think he means it... But even so, you two sure are close. What's your relationship with him?"""
st_054070_0070#0,"""Well, that's..."""
st_054070_0080#0,"""Sina and I were experimental demon soldiers."""
st_054070_0090#0,"""Experimental demon soldiers?"""
st_054070_0100#0,"""Just as Cuent used Ephimera to create Devil Castles, Verun had its own magic."""
st_054070_0110#0,"""It is known as Demonization. Magic that strengthens the body by infusing it with Mana."""
st_054070_0120#0,"""Naturally, this magic took a certain amount of skill to use. Only a few people could perform it."""
st_054070_0130#0,"""However, all that changed with the discovery of Ephimera."""
st_054070_0140#0,"""With Ephimera's help, just being able to use magic was enough. Skill was no longer an issue."""
st_054070_0150#0,"""Of course, most people cannot use magic at all..."""
st_054070_0160#0,"""Thus, by imperial decree, the Imperial Demon Soldier Project was formed."""
st_054070_0170#0,"""Our gracious Emperor would take the weak and the useless, and turn them into powerful soldiers, out of the goodness of his heart. Ha."""
st_054070_0180#0,"""That damned magical flower, Ephimera, took care of all that for him."""
st_054070_0190#0,"""So they forced those without magical affinity to become demons. Likely by experimenting on their bodies..."""
st_054070_0200#0,"""Oh, good guess, short stuff. You talking from experience or something?"""
st_054070_0210#0,"""But doing that would make their bodies burn out."""
st_054070_0220#0,"""Hahaha! That's right, short stuff. A guess like that, it's like you've seen it happen before!"""
st_054070_0230#0,"""But I bet you've never seen someone filled with Mana till they break, right? You don't know about all the things that can happen, do you?"""
st_054070_0240#0,"""Gettemhart and I were part of the Demon Soldier Project's first batch of test subjects. We managed to escape the facility."""
st_054070_0250#0,"""There were originally four thousand ninety-six of us, but now we are all that's left. We're sure that no-one else survived."""
st_054070_0260#0,"""Wait, if your strength comes from demonization, doesn't that mean you're risking your lives..."""
st_054070_0270#0,"""Ha, I couldn't care less about a damned life like this!"""
st_054070_0280#0,"""All I want is the Emperor. To crush him with my own hands."""
st_054070_0290#0,"""I'll make him pay for what he did to me, and Sina, and everyone else. He'll pay with his life."""
st_054070_0300#0,"""So, Guardian. Don't pull that goody two-shoes \""take care of yourself\"" act on me, alright?"""
st_054070_0310#0,"""You want to beat the Emperor too, don't you? If you want to make yourself useful, go ahead. But if you get in my way, I'll crush you first."""
st_054070_0320#0,"""I must apologize for his attitude... But I feel the same way."""
st_054070_0330#0,"""I live to avenge those who were killed by the Emperor's whims. That's all that I have left."""
st_054070_0340#0,"""We fight for one reason. To kill the Emperor."""
st_054070_0350#0,"""..."""
st_054070_0360#0,"""1. Scared?"""
st_054070_0370#0,"""2. What's the matter?"""
st_054070_0380#0,"""Oh, sorry, I was lost in thought. While I did feel scared, there were other things I was curious about..."""
st_054070_0390#0,"""Oh, sorry, I was lost in thought. That was an interesting story..."""
st_054070_0400#0,"""These Demon Soldiers. It's similar to the story of how the Photoners created ARKS."""
st_054070_0410#0,"""Abducting a large number of tough-bodied creatures and genetically modifying them, infusing them with Photons to try and induce aptitude..."""
st_054070_0420#0,"""The records show that many lives were lost in trying to stabilize and mass-produce the process... It was a truly dark time in our history."""
st_054070_0430#0,"""To see it happen again, if only on Omega... We have to stop this..."""
