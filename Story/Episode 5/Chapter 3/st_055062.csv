st_055060_0030#0,"""Big brother Luther, where are we going?"""
st_055060_0040#0,"""You'll just have to wait and see."""
st_055060_0050#0,"""But... I need to finish my etiquette studies back at the Royal Court..."""
st_055060_0060#0,"""You're a diligent learner.<br>You can be done with that in a day and have nothing to worry about."""
st_055060_0070#0,"""Well, I promised Mother that I would study properly every day. If I don't keep my promise, it would be terribly rude to Mother."""
st_055060_0080#0,"""I also made a promise to her.<br>In order to keep that promise, I've brought you with me.<br>To this place."""
st_055060_0090#0,"""Wow! The whole place is covered in flowers!"""
st_055060_0100#0,"""This was Mother's favorite place. She told me to bring you here. I certainly couldn't ignore her final wish."""
st_055060_0110#0,"""Mother's favorite place.<br>So this is where she went..."""

st_055060_0150#0,"""The only ones here are you, myself...<br>and Mother's spirit watching over this place."""
st_055060_0160#0,"""Mother's... spirit..."""
st_055060_0170#0,"""She's right here with you. I'm not lying about that just to make you feel better, either; it's the truth."""

st_055060_0210#0,"""Big brother... Big brother!"""
st_055060_0220#0,"""I don't think this is what you meant by looking after her, but... Ah well."""
st_055060_0230#0,"""Well now! I guess you don't hate me, then?"""
st_055060_0240#0,"""I... would never hate my big brother."""
st_055060_0250#0,"""I thought it was just you who disliked everyone. Or rather, you had no interest in anyone else, I should say."""

st_055060_0330#0,"""Just now, I..."""
st_055060_0340#0,"""Luther's memories?"""
st_055060_0350#0,"""You saw Luther's memories? But, why would something like that..."""
st_055060_0360#0,"""Are the Darkers we just fought from that Devil Castle connected to Luther's memories?"""
st_055060_0370#0,"""It must be another phenomenon from being inside the Akashic Record."""
st_055060_0380#0,"""At any rate, I have a bad feeling about this. We have to hurry and find Harriet!"""
