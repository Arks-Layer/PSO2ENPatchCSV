st_055060_0020#0,"""Huh, what's wrong?!"""
st_055060_0030#0,"""Big brother Luther, where are we going?"""
st_055060_0040#0,"""You'll just have to wait and see."""
st_055060_0050#0,"""But... I need to finish my etiquette studies back at the Royal Court..."""
st_055060_0060#0,"""You're a diligent learner. You can be done with that in a day and have nothing to worry about."""
st_055060_0070#0,"""Well, I promised Mother that I would study properly every day. If I don't keep my promise, it would be terribly rude to Mother."""
st_055060_0080#0,"""I also made a promise to her. In order to keep that promise, I've brought you with me. To this place."""
st_055060_0090#0,"""Wow! The whole place is covered in flowers!"""
st_055060_0100#0,"""This was Mother's favorite place. She told me to bring you here. I certainly couldn't ignore her final wish."""
st_055060_0110#0,"""Mother's favorite place.<br>So this is where she went..."""
st_055060_0120#0,"""Tears are unbefitting of royalty. Royalty mustn't show weakness before the people."""
st_055060_0130#0,"""Under... stood!"""
st_055060_0140#0,"""But, there aren't any people here. You needn't put up a brave front here."""
st_055060_0150#0,"""The only ones here are you, myself...<br>and Mother's spirit watching over this place."""
st_055060_0160#0,"""Mother's... spirit..."""
st_055060_0170#0,"""She's right here with you. I'm not lying about that just to make you feel better, either; it's the truth."""
st_055060_0180#0,"""Mother...! Mother...! I miss your hugs... I miss you brushing my hair... I've wanted to hear you praise me!"""
st_055060_0190#0,"""Mother... Mother...! Mother...!"""
st_055060_0200#0,"""There you go. Let it all out. You can't keep those tears in forever."""
st_055060_0210#0,"""Big brother... Big brother!"""
st_055060_0220#0,"""I don't think this is what you meant by looking after her, but... Ah well."""
st_055060_0230#0,"""Well now! I guess you don't hate me, then?"""
st_055060_0240#0,"""I... would never hate my big brother."""
st_055060_0250#0,"""But I thought you hated everyone. Or, maybe you just aren't interested in other people?"""
st_055060_0260#0,"""Why do you think that?"""
st_055060_0270#0,"""Because you're too smart for everyone else."""
st_055060_0280#0,"""Hehe. Hahaha... Hahahaha!"""
st_055060_0290#0,"""B-brother? What's wrong? Did I say something strange?!"""
st_055060_0300#0,"""I'm humbled, Harriet. I must be blind to have not noticed someone so interesting was right here all this time."""
st_055060_0310#0,"""Even if just a little, I've become quite interested in seeing how far your achievements will take you."""
st_055060_0320#0,"""Are you okay? Stay with me here!"""
st_055060_0330#0,"""Just now, I..."""
st_055060_0340#0,"""Luther's memories?"""
st_055060_0350#0,"""You saw Luther's memories? But, why would something like that..."""
st_055060_0360#0,"""Are the Darkers we just fought from that Devil Castle connected to Luther's memories?"""
st_055060_0370#0,"""It must be another phenomenon from being inside the Akashic Record."""
st_055060_0380#0,"""At any rate, I have a bad feeling about this. We have to hurry and find Harriet!"""
