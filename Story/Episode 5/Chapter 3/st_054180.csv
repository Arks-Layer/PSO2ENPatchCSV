st_054180_0010#0,"""Xiao, is it really alright that <%me> has this new power?"""
st_054180_0020#0,"""You worry too much, Matoi. As I said, there's no abnormalities."""
st_054180_0030#0,"""There's nothing odd about their parameters, and I don't see signs of Darker Factor being too high."""
st_054180_0040#0,"""It's completely different from when you transformed into the [Profound Darkness]. Rather, it's more like the other way around."""
st_054180_0050#0,"""What about you, <%me>? Do you feel anything wrong?"""
st_054180_0060#0,"""Well..."""
st_054180_0070#0,"""I hear voices..."""
st_054180_0080#0,"""Oi, it'll be annoying if they can<br>see me. Don't say unnecessary things."""
st_054180_0090#0,"""Instead of just absorbing the power you took, you can now fight by manifesting as a Dark Falz... It's similar to Embodied Weapons from Earth."""
st_054180_0100#0,"""You weren't able to do something like this before, so why now?"""
st_054180_0110#0,"""Hmm... Maybe this is due to some sort of influence from Ephimera."""
st_054180_0120#0,"""Perhaps <%me>'s Photons reacted with it, forming a new kind of power?"""
st_054180_0130#0,"""But isn't Ephimera something like a fragment of the [Profound Darkness]?"""
st_054180_0140#0,"""Well, considering <%me>'s power..."""
st_054180_0150#0,"""Xiera. Who do you think is the host of the [Profound Darkness]?"""
st_054180_0160#0,"""Ah..."""
st_054180_0170#0,"""So, I wonder...<br>I don't get a bad feeling from you."""
st_054180_0180#0,"""I agree with Second Generation.<br>Your Photons seem to be clean. How do you feel?"""
st_054180_0190#0,"""Matoi is prone to worrying, but she's right to do so."""
st_054180_0200#0,"""I'll keep looking into it, but... For now, I'm just glad there's nothing wrong."""
