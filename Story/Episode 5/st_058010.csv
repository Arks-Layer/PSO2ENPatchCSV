st_058010_0010#0,"""What is that over there?!"""
st_058010_0020#0,"""That should be obvious. 'Tis a cocoon, of course. One that envelopes the fledgeling Profound."""
st_058010_0030#0,"""You... You're Elmir!"""
st_058010_0040#0,"""We've not met since Epic. I came to offer a formal greeting, comrade."""
st_058010_0050#0,"""Greeting...?"""
st_058010_0060#0,"""What are you talking about...?"""
st_058010_0070#0,"""Hahahahah! You wound me, comrade!"""
st_058010_0080#0,"""Oh well. I'll give you a nice big hint."""
st_058010_0090#0,"""Guess whoooo?"""
st_058010_0100#0,"""Hahahah, careful with that! This was once yours, wasn't it? Or rather, it belonged to the future you?"""
st_058010_0110#0,"""You're...!"""
st_058010_0120#0,"""Dark Falz...!"""
st_058010_0130#0,"""You've got it. I am Dark Falz [Persona]. He who has inherited that title."""
st_058010_0140#0,"""[Profound Darkness] assimilated with the Akashic Record."""
st_058010_0150#0,"""The darkness that leaked out from within found its way to me... To the unborn Elmir."""
st_058010_0160#0,"""Get it now? The Ephimera and I were both brought into this world together."""
st_058010_0170#0,"""But really, I was in quite the pickle. The Dark Falz Factors were all split up."""
st_058010_0180#0,"""Without them I could never become [Profound Darkness], I would just be a half-baked Dark Falz. Woe was me! Until you showed up."""
st_058010_0190#0,"""You really did pull through. Defeating all of them and returning their Factors to me."""
st_058010_0200#0,"""Returning them...?"""
st_058010_0210#0,"""Oho? Don't tell me you didn't notice."""
st_058010_0220#0,"""No matter how strong you think you are, there's no way you could handle the true power of a Dark Falz."""
st_058010_0230#0,"""I took the Factors for myself. All you got were the leftovers. Everyone got their share!"""
st_058010_0240#0,"""But taking the Factors... How is that even possible...!"""
st_058010_0250#0,"""My my, the grandchild of the Akashic Record sure isn't up to snuff."""
st_058010_0260#0,"""[Profound Darkness] latched on to the physical representation of the Akashic Record, no? Then the Factors' destination should be obvious."""
st_058010_0270#0,"""Bingo. This world itself is [Profound Darkness]. My humble birthplace."""
st_058010_0280#0,"""Though I must say, things sure have gone awry. Even I didn't intend for this outcome. Why should I have had to expose myself so?"""
st_058010_0290#0,"""I planned to wait, biding my time until the perfect moment, unbeknownst to anyone at all."""
st_058010_0300#0,"""But... But, you see. That Luther fellow does nothing but meddle, no matter the time or place."""
st_058010_0310#0,"""I don't know whether it was through summoning or otherwise, but he gained access to me and brought me into being."""
st_058010_0315#0,"""My meticulously crafted plan was all for naught."""
st_058010_0320#0,"""He even had the gall to steal my vessel.<br>I couldn't stay silent any longer."""
st_058010_0330#0,"""By having the humans enter into large-scale conflict, I would have the vessel and Factors returned to me."""
st_058010_0340#0,"""Ahh, that's right, the vessel. I owe you my thanks for that as well, comrade. You did a wonderful job of keeping it safe."""
st_058010_0350#0,"""Thanks to you, I can achieve rebirth under ideal conditions using the power I've amassed."""
st_058010_0360#0,"""...Your vessel?"""
st_058010_0370#0,"""What are you talking about?"""
st_058010_0380#0,"""Hmmm, now what was it called again...?"""
st_058010_0390#0,"""...Ah, that's right! Harriet was its name, no?"""
st_058010_0400#0,"""What have you done with Harriet?!"""
st_058010_0410#0,"""...It can't be."""
st_058010_0420#0,"""Inside of that cocoon..."""
st_058010_0430#0,"""Ding ding! Nice going, comrade! So you know what that means, then... Do you not?"""
st_058010_0440#0,"""I can only exist here. I am only needed here."""
st_058010_0450#0,"""That is why. I won't stop until everything is consumed."""
st_058010_0460#0,"""That's what being a Dark Falz means. Right, comrade?"""
st_058010_0470#0,"""Then I'll stop you here!"""
st_058010_0480#0,"""I won't let you get away with this!"""
st_058010_0490#0,"""Careful! Haste makes waste, they say. You're much too late anyway."""
st_058010_0500#0,"""Ta-ta, comrade. Your heroic tale of world destruction was quite fascinating."""
st_058010_0505#0,"""Hahaha, ahahah, hahahahahah!"""
st_058010_0510#0,"""...We have an emergency, you two. Sorry about this, but I'm calling you back."""
