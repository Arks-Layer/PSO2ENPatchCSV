st_054130_0010#0,"""What is this... This overwhelming strength, Guardian...!"""
st_054130_0020#0,"""No. This is also... that failure."""
st_054130_0030#0,"""Incredible...! I... lost...!"""
st_054130_0040#0,"""<%me>! Are you ok!?"""
st_054130_0050#0,"""1. This power..."""
st_054130_0060#0,"""2. Besides that, the other two..."""
st_054130_0070#0,"""I don't know either... The energy signal was exactly that of Dark Falz [Elder]..."""
st_054130_0080#0,"""That's right, Melphonsina is..."""
st_054130_0090#0,"""Gettemhart is no longer here. And Melphonsina is..."""
st_054130_0100#0,"""Oi, <%me>.<br>Show me your thanks for letting you use my strength."""
st_054130_0110#0,"""Yo Sina.<br>That was a pretty bad performance we had."""
st_054130_0120#0,"""Well, Gettemhart... Taking a hit and instead being used like a doll, that was clumsy of me."""
st_054130_0130#0,"""But it's finished... <%me> finished it for us."""
st_054130_0140#0,"""Yeah, I saw. It was as expected from the Guardian. Thank you very much..."""
st_054130_0150#0,"""It took forever, getting here."""
st_054130_0160#0,"""Yeah, it took forever."""
st_054130_0170#0,"""I'm so tired now... Everyone won't get mad if I sleep now, right?"""
st_054130_0180#0,"""Hah, I won't let those who took a break earlier complain about it."""
st_054130_0190#0,"""So then, guess I'll sleep then..."""
st_054130_0200#0,"""Right."""
st_054130_0210#0,"""Goodbye, Gettemhart..."""
st_054130_0220#0,"""See you, Sina."""
st_054130_0230#0,"""This is our final stop. For both Sina, who is a memory, and I, who no longer exist. This is the end of our records."""
st_054130_0240#0,"""However, <%me>.<br>This isn't your end. There's things<br>you still have yet to do."""
st_054130_0250#0,"""Ephimera and the Devil Castles... They're the root of destruction in this world."""
st_054130_0260#0,"""There's so many of those Devil Castles left in Verun."""
st_054130_0270#0,"""We have to do something about them...<br>Otherwise, how could we face those two."""
st_054120_0430#0,"""I've been consumed by [Elder] and now I'm being consumed by the Guardian. Hah, what a weird twist of fate this is..."""
st_054120_0440#0,"""I knew that we had the same aura when we first met at Naberius... However, I'd never imagine that I'd be absorbed by you."""
st_054120_0450#0,"""I won't be bothering to ask what's going on. It's all a whim of the Akashic Record after all. Just thinking about it is useless."""
st_054120_0460#0,"""Now go, use my power... This power, the power of [Elder]."""
st_054120_0470#0,"""And save them... Show me how you handle things."""
st_054120_0480#0,"""<%me>, you've gained Gettemhart's Photons..."""
st_054120_0490#0,"""No, this is... [Elder]'s energy signal!"""
st_054120_0500#0,"""<%me>... What is this?"""
st_054120_0510#0,"""It's like you're a... Darker!"""
st_054120_0520#0,"""Kehaha, ahahaha. So you've obtained a power similar to my own! You are indeed a worthy opponent!"""
st_054120_0530#0,"""Guardian, it seems that it will be a one vs one fight between us!"""
st_054120_0540#0,"""1. I'm not alone."""
st_054120_0550#0,"""2. There's three here."""
st_054120_0560#0,"""Our thoughts... We entrust them to you."""
