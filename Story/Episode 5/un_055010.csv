un_055010_0020#0,"""Cut it out already, Aurora. I thought you were supposed to have been the goddess of beauty."""
un_055010_0030#0,"""I can't help it, something seems off. Besides, do I look like the kind of girl who would cling to her past?"""
un_055010_0040#0,"""...That's rich, coming from you."""
un_055010_0050#0,"""What are you two doing? You look kind of suspicious."""
un_055010_0060#0,"""Ms. Former Goddess of Beauty here said she felt something, and started acting all weird. You have any idea what it could be?"""
un_055010_0070#0,"""Do I have any idea...?"""
un_055010_0080#0,"""Hm? Ah, I got it! It's coming from you, <%me>! You've got this weird smell coming from you!"""
un_055010_0090#0,"""From <%me>? I'm not detecting anything on their person that could be causing a weird smell..."""
un_055010_0100#0,"""How close did you check? There's deeefinitely something off. A lady's intuition is never wrong."""
un_055010_0110#0,"""...So it's just a hunch? It's not any kind of concrete sensation?"""
un_055010_0120#0,"""Wellll... It feels nostalgic, and scary?"""
un_055010_0130#0,"""Huh? Those aren't smells at all."""
un_055010_0140#0,"""Shut up, Yu! You asked me to describe it so I did!"""
un_055010_0150#0,"""If it's something you can sense like that, then what were you running around with your nose in the air for? You looked ridiculous."""
un_055010_0160#0,"""Th-That was... It increased the range of my perception!"""
un_055010_0170#0,"""I should have guessed the Goddess of Beauty would be an expert on scent."""
un_055010_0180#0,"""You went there! You really went there! I can't believe you'd say something so dumb!"""
un_055010_0190#0,"""What could Aurora find nostalgic and scary...?"""
un_055010_0200#0,"""Could it be the Photoners?"""
un_055010_0210#0,"""Could it be Dark Falz?"""
un_055010_0220#0,"""That's one possibility, but we can't rule out the possibility of it being related to Dark Falz, either."""
un_055010_0230#0,"""Yeah, it could be that. Since it's Aurora, it's possible that it's connected to the Photoners as well."""
un_055010_0240#0,"""Aurora's body is just an accumulation of Photons in her image... So it's possible it's related to the other world."""
