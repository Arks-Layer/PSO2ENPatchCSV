st_058025_0020#0,"""Which means, that would have been around the same time [Profound Darkness] entered it."""
st_058025_0030#0,"""If <%me> was supposed to have reached Omega at roughly the same time, why is there such a big gap?"""
st_058025_0040#0,"""Ahem. Why don't I take this chance to explain?"""
st_058025_0050#0,"""...As I've probably said before, inside the Akashic Record is a big jumbled up mess of time."""
st_058025_0060#0,"""While the records are being sorted, a whole bunch of worlds are wriggling all around crazy fast."""
st_058025_0070#0,"""[Profound Darkness] entered and tainted it, and an instant later, <%me> entered as well."""
st_058025_0080#0,"""I noticed the moment <%me> showed up and synchronized time."""
st_058025_0090#0,"""You... synchronized time?"""
st_058025_0100#0,"""Ahh, umm... Just think of it as me making it work right."""
st_058025_0110#0,"""But it was in that instant. The tiniest difference is equivalent to dozens of years in that world."""
st_058025_0120#0,"""And Omega was a big jumble of time during that. Well, the Akashic Record was."""
st_058025_0130#0,"""And I guess jumble of time isn't really quite right either. The records were all jumbling up, more like."""
st_058025_0140#0,"""Then, what would have happened if you hadn't stopped time back then...?"""
st_058025_0150#0,"""Hmm, if I had to guess, the black hole would have instantly expanded and swallowed everything up."""
st_058025_0160#0,"""Guess you could say I've got some amazingly good timing."""
