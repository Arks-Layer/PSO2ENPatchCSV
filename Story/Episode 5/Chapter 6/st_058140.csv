st_058140_0160#0,"""My vessel was taken... Implanted with some other soul... Their bond was surprisingly resilient..."""

st_058140_0250#0,"""Now, comrade. The real fun can begin. How about another round?"""
st_058140_0270#0,"""These readings...they're totally different from the Dark Falz we've seen before! They're on the same level as [Profound Darkness]...!"""
