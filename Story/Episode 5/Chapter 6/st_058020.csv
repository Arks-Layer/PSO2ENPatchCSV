st_058020_0010#0,"""Sorry again for the sudden return... Are you alright?"""
st_058020_0020#0,"""<%me>... You look so serious. Did something happen?"""
st_058020_0030#0,"""It's a long story."""
st_058020_0040#0,"""What about that emergency...?"""
st_058020_0050#0,"""...Right. It's likely that the two are related. I'll explain what's happening here first."""
st_058020_0060#0,"""The black hole is expanding rapidly. Rather than growing as it draws things inside, it's very clearly swelling from within."""
st_058020_0070#0,"""Here's what our current observations show."""
st_058020_0080#0,"""...What is that noise?"""
st_058020_0090#0,"""Even though sound cannot travel through space, we can hear it throbbing. That alone is strange enough, however..."""
st_058020_0100#0,"""It's continuing to expand all while beating like a heart."""
st_058020_0110#0,"""...<%me>. Xiera."""
st_058020_0120#0,"""Could you tell us exactly what happened in Omega?"""
st_058020_0130#0,"""...Yes."""
st_058020_0140#0,"""Omega itself... is [Profound Darkness]."""
st_058020_0150#0,"""...So it didn't just attach itself to Omega."""
st_058020_0160#0,"""It's more like Omega is sitting on the back of [Profound Darkness]."""
st_058020_0170#0,"""...Still, that's strange. Where could its physical incarnation have gone?"""
st_058020_0180#0,"""That guy who claimed to be [Persona] could have been lying... But what reason would he have to deceive us?"""
st_058020_0190#0,"""We can't afford to take this situation lightly."""
st_058020_0200#0,"""The [Persona] we knew is no more, and Elmir has now assumed their role. We should move forward under the assumption that all of this is true."""
st_058020_0210#0,"""If Elmir and that cocoon are the cause of this, then our issues should be solved if we do something about them."""
st_058020_0220#0,"""By \""do something about them\"", you mean destroying them... Will such a thing even be possible?"""
st_058020_0230#0,"""And if we do manage to do it... What will happen to Harriet?"""
st_058020_0240#0,"""Giving up without even trying...? Pitiful."""
st_058020_0250#0,"""...Let's go."""
st_058020_0260#0,"""We can still make a difference."""
st_058020_0270#0,"""<%me>...! Yeah, you're right! There's still a chance!"""
st_058020_0280#0,"""Just because we don't know what'll happen... doesn't mean we shouldn't do anything at all."""
st_058020_0290#0,"""We've always done everything we could to get through situations we didn't understand in the slightest... We just have to do whatever we can."""
st_058020_0300#0,"""We'll try to figure something out on our end. You two should continue investigating Omega."""
st_058020_0310#0,"""There isn't much time left now. And yet, we can still play our parts. <%me> is exactly right."""
st_058020_0320#0,"""Let's head to Cuent first. Without Harriet around, it's probably in total chaos."""
