st_058040_0020#0,"""After all, everything in this world is your sustenance. An endless bounty for you to enjoy. Eat to your heart's content."""
st_058040_0030#0,"""...What are you planning? What do you intend to do with me?"""
st_058040_0040#0,"""Nothing at all. I won't be doing anything. By us simply 'being', the world will fall to ruin. That is our reality."""
st_058040_0050#0,"""You understand, don't you Harriet? The truth about the black liquid poisoning this land. It is our very essence."""
st_058040_0060#0,"""Corrupting Mana... Photons, consuming them, spreading, distorting. That is how the world will become unified."""

st_058040_0130#0,"""That..."""
st_058040_0140#0,"""Well well, if it isn't our comrade. I did my best to warn them, and yet they will not relent."""
st_058040_0150#0,"""It appears they're incapable of understanding such a simple concept as futility."""
st_058040_0160#0,"""...Guardian."""
st_058040_0170#0,"""...I see. Your hope rides on them."""
