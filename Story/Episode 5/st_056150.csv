st_056150_0020#0,"""The group resumed their march. Crushing any Devil Castles in their path,<br>they made their way to the Northern Fortress. However, a heavy<br>doubt slowed their progress."""
st_056150_0030#0,"""The enemy's strength is to be feared, surely, but just<br>how fearsome a circumstance would await them next?"""
st_056150_0040#0,"""The coming conflicts would be nothing like their past battles.<br>They would need to summon up a new kind of courage."""
st_056150_0050#0,"""It would seem you've bested Suzuki somehow..."""
st_056150_0060#0,"""Hmhmm... However! She was the weakest one among us!"""
st_056150_0070#0,"""Not to belittle our great name, but I am many leagues stronger than she!"""
st_056150_0080#0,"""All of you will perish here! At that hands of Rina the Isolated, of the Four Infernal Guardians of [Apprentice]!"""
st_056150_0090#0,"""Ooooooh! Yes, yes, yes! This is it! This fusion of passion and dramaticism is perfect!"""
st_056150_0100#0,"""...I've finished scanning our databases. Her name is Rina Izumi, she's a citizen of Earth who's currently missing."""
st_056150_0110#0,"""The sheer ridiculousness emanating from her is almost definitely not her fault, but Marge's..."""
st_056150_0120#0,"""Certainly, you may possess great power... However! Yours is but a self-serving strength!"""
st_056150_0130#0,"""What?!"""
st_056150_0140#0,"""True strength is something achieved together with your allies! If you stand before us<br>partnerless, then you've already lost this battle!"""
st_056150_0150#0,"""Rrgh... Wh-who says I'm partnerless?! I... I'm not...<br>I'm not alone at all!"""
st_056150_0160#0,"""Hah, cease your bluffing! I know exactly what happened!"""
st_056150_0170#0,"""After you were summoned, you thought about striking up conversation with the other three, but they all ditched you before you could, didn't they?!"""
st_056150_0180#0,"""S... Silence! Don't you dare speak another word!"""
st_056150_0190#0,"""I can't stand to watch this anymore. For the sake of their pride, we should really hurry up and defeat them."""
st_056150_0200#0,"""My sentiments exactly! I'll make you fools regret ever crossing me!"""
st_056150_0210#0,"""SORO!"""
