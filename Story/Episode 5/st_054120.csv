st_054120_0006#0,"""Guh, gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"""
st_054120_0010#0,"""My strength is draining...?!<br>No, it's being devoured?"""
st_054120_0020#0,"""Hehe, Guardian... This is your doing, isn't it? Such a mysterious ability you have."""
st_054120_0030#0,"""But because of that... it's worth it to take it away!"""
st_054120_0040#0,"""Hah, heheh... To be struck down by experimental trash... But that is why it's been so entertaining...!"""
st_054120_0050#0,"""Hah... Hah..."""
st_054120_0060#0,"""Gettemhart!"""
st_054120_0070#0,"""Is this it? Is this how it ends?"""
st_054120_0080#0,"""Damned Emperor, is this how you wanted it...! Just to be taken down by the strongest, without leaving anything else...!"""
st_054120_0090#0,"""Let's leave, Gettemhart. Even if the Emperor is dead, our battle isn't over just yet."""
st_054120_0100#0,"""Yes, the battle isn't finished just yet... I'll leave a tear in this world."""
st_054120_0110#0,"""1. Watch out!"""
st_054120_0120#0,"""2. Move out of the way!"""
st_054120_0130#0,"""Gettemhart!"""
st_054120_0140#0,"""Sina! Are you ok? Huh!?"""
st_054120_0150#0,"""Yes... I am fine."""
st_054120_0155#0,"""This vessel moves better than I had expected."""
st_054120_0160#0,"""Wha-- Ugh--!"""
st_054120_0170#0,"""Although having to steal this inferior body was a minor setback... It's not bad at all. This vessel is quite adequate."""
st_054120_0180#0,"""1. Wait, no, Schlegger!?"""
st_054120_0190#0,"""2. You stole her body!?"""
st_054120_0200#0,"""Correct. Claiming a body by possessing another. This is the secret art of Demonization."""
st_054120_0210#0,"""Using Demonization, our Mana is forced inside a body, which from there it is then utilized. It's not a foreign concept."""
st_054120_0220#0,"""In a single vessel, two souls are useless. Therefore, the weaker soul is devoured and the stronger remains. No further explanation is necessary."""
st_054120_0230#0,"""Sina... is gone... Don't bullshit me..."""
st_054120_0240#0,"""Hehehe. You move well despite taking such a fatal blow. However, in your state, you won't last more than a few minutes."""
st_054120_0250#0,"""Hah--ck... Damn you--guhhh!"""
st_054120_0260#0,"""Oh, did you love and care about the person this body belonged to? Well, I could have let you have some fun with it, however save it for the afterlife."""
st_054120_0270#0,"""Don't...mess with...me! Sina's body... Isn't your--ckaaa!"""
st_054120_0280#0,"""You can't, you mustn't! Can't we just talk things over!?"""
st_054120_0290#0,"""Guardian, let's have a rematch without this trash. It shall be different than my previous broken body."""
st_054120_0300#0,"""What's wrong? Afraid to strike this body, this face? That's fine, you shall just die as you were. The victor is justice after all."""
st_054120_0310#0,"""What...! I can't control what this body is doing...!"""
st_054120_0320#0,"""Sina...?"""
st_054120_0330#0,"""Gettemhart... Guardian... I don't... want this..."""
st_054120_0340#0,"""Please...! You have to... kill me and the Emperor...!!"""
st_054120_0350#0,"""Hah! What! So, you were still in there after all! Alas, this will be the end of it!"""
st_054120_0360#0,"""What...! You're still moving, what are you?!"""
st_054120_0370#0,"""Even if I'm dying... I still have my pride... How can I die and not fulfill Sina's wish...?!"""
st_054120_0380#0,"""Gettemhart, wait!"""
st_054120_0390#0,"""This is annoying... I don't have enough strength to defeat the Emperor."""
st_054120_0400#0,"""However, it's possible to transfer this strength. My soul, this damned strength...!"""
st_054120_0410#0,"""It pisses me off... but this is better than nothing! I don't want to die doing nothing!"""
st_054120_0420#0,"""If that happened... Then I couldn't face Sina!"""
st_054120_0430#0,"""I've been consumed by [Elder] and now I'm being consumed by the Guardian. Hah, what a weird twist of fate this is..."""
st_054120_0440#0,"""I knew that we had the same aura when we first met on Naberius... However, I never imagined that I'd be absorbed by you."""
st_054120_0450#0,"""I won't be bothering to ask what's going on. It's all a whim of the Akashic Record after all. Just thinking about it is useless."""
st_054120_0460#0,"""Now go, use my power... This power, the power of [Elder]."""
st_054120_0470#0,"""And save them... Show me how you handle things."""
st_054120_0480#0,"""<%me>, you've gained Gettemhart's Photons..."""
st_054120_0490#0,"""No, this is... [Elder]'s energy patterns!"""
st_054120_0500#0,"""<%me>... What is this?"""
st_054120_0510#0,"""But this form... It's [Elder]'s!"""
st_054120_0520#0,"""Kehaha, ahahaha! So you've obtained a power similar to my own! You are indeed a worthy opponent!"""
st_054120_0530#0,"""Guardian, it seems that it will be a one on one fight between us!"""
st_054120_0540#0,"""1. I'm not alone."""
st_054120_0550#0,"""2. There's three here."""
st_054120_0560#0,"""Our thoughts... We entrust them to you."""
st_054120_0570#0,"""Use everything you've got and hit him hard!"""
