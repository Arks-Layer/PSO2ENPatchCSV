st_058160_0010#0,"""Preposterous... I am... defeated...?"""
st_058160_0020#0,"""Indeed. You have been defeated by the Guardian."""
st_058160_0030#0,"""The Ephimera's been purified... So why are you here! Why won't you disappear, Harriet!"""
st_058160_0040#0,"""The world is decided by one's will... I desire to see the future, therefore, I stand here now."""
st_058160_0050#0,"""...But it's pointless, pointless I say! This world is a perpetual loop!"""
st_058160_0060#0,"""Even if you defeat me here, I will reappear countless times! That's the kind of place this is!"""
st_058160_0070#0,"""Heheh, heheheh, hahahahah! So this really is our history... Or rather, the end of our history..."""
st_058160_0080#0,"""Vanishing here might be a more desirable fate than sticking around."""
st_058160_0090#0,"""What do you mean?"""
st_058160_0100#0,"""Do not think hope is all the future holds. Do not think your days to come will be bathed in light. Despair hangs in the air all around you."""
st_058160_0110#0,"""Repeat it and suffer, suffer over and over! Take the world's resentment... Despair and die...!"""
st_058160_0120#0,"""Hahahah, ahahahaha!"""
st_058160_0130#0,"""He sounded really desperate there, but it was probably all talk..."""
st_058160_0140#0,"""...But enough of that. Are you okay, Harriet?"""
st_058160_0150#0,"""I am not sure... if I would say I am alright, but... My heart is here."""
st_058160_0160#0,"""It is all thanks to you, Guardian."""
st_058160_0170#0,"""However, I have done great harm to this world and everyone living in it..."""
st_058160_0180#0,"""Even having survived, I..."""
st_058160_0190#0,"""Harrieeeeeeet! You're alright! You're alright! Ohhhhh, thank goodness!"""
st_058160_0200#0,"""Ma-Margareta...?!"""
st_058160_0210#0,"""...You have been through much, Lady Harriet. Let us enjoy our reunion first."""
st_058160_0220#0,"""Lady Alisa too..."""
st_058160_0230#0,"""Hm? What's up with that gloomy look? Shouldn't you be happy? You're still alive."""
st_058160_0240#0,"""Still alive... Oh, no, but I... I caused a great deal of trouble..."""
st_058160_0250#0,"""You dummy! Why are you fretting over the small details?! A queen that doesn't cause trouble is no queen at all!"""
st_058160_0260#0,"""Besides, it wasn't your fault this time, it was all that Elmir guy! There's nothing for you to feel guilty about!"""
st_058160_0270#0,"""Just look at my God! Always wandering off or enacting retribution on a whim! That's the sort of thing that causes people trouble!"""
st_058160_0280#0,"""Can it, you dumbass queen. You sound like<br>you're hankering for some retribution right now."""
st_058160_0290#0,"""Agh, o' God...! It was a... figure of speech, or something... I-I swear I'm telling the truth!"""
st_058160_0300#0,"""Ah whatever, gods are a magnanimous bunch. I'll postpone your punishment for now."""
st_058160_0310#0,"""But you're still going to?!"""
st_058160_0320#0,"""More importantly, you know what'll happen right? You're gonna end up disappearing like that."""
st_058160_0330#0,"""Your vessel is gone. You're just the remnants of a soul."""
st_058160_0340#0,"""Right now they're holding together, but without anything to anchor your soul, they'll lose their form eventually."""
st_058160_0350#0,"""...Yes. I am aware. It is a miracle that I was able to hold on to my self at all."""
st_058160_0360#0,"""I was able to see everyone one last time. I do not mind if my record ends here. That is how I truly feel."""
st_058160_0370#0,"""H-How can you be so nonchalant?! We finally became friends... There's no way I can say goodbye so soon!"""
st_058160_0380#0,"""Hey you! You're a god, can't you do something for her?"""
st_058160_0390#0,"""You seriously need to learn some manners. Although, that foolhardiness is what I love about you."""
st_058160_0400#0,"""Harriet. History needs your soul to stay."""
st_058160_0410#0,"""So you're taking over for me. As my successor... As its God, you will watch over this world."""
st_058160_0420#0,"""...If you agree, I'll become your body for you."""
st_058160_0430#0,"""I'm a bit of an expert on that, you see. I did the same thing once before."""
st_058160_0440#0,"""Achoo!"""
st_058160_0450#0,"""But, if you were to do that... Would Epic not be troubled by the loss of their divine power...?"""
st_058160_0460#0,"""Divine power?! The world needs you way more than it needs crap like that, Harriet!"""
st_058160_0470#0,"""Hahaha! Is that how you really feel?"""
st_058160_0480#0,"""Your total disregard for consequence is great! You're just like my favorite little friend!"""
st_058160_0490#0,"""Achoo! Achoo!"""
st_058160_0500#0,"""I'm just a ghost anyway. Something that doesn't belong here. You've got nothing to worry about."""
st_058160_0510#0,"""If I'm gonna disappear, I wanna make it count. Think of it as a present from God granted on a whim."""
st_058160_0520#0,"""You saved Margareta."""
st_058160_0530#0,"""You saved Alma."""
st_058160_0540#0,"""So all I'm doing is returning the favor."""
st_058160_0550#0,"""...Understood. Thank you, for all that you've done."""
st_058160_0560#0,"""...I don't really get what happened, but you're our God now, right?"""
st_058160_0570#0,"""Does that mean Epic and Cuent are going to merge with each other?"""
st_058160_0580#0,"""In that case, they'll need a new name! Like, the Divine Magic Kingdom of Epicuent!"""
st_058160_0590#0,"""Marge... You're even terrible at naming things."""
st_058160_0600#0,"""Whaddya mean \""even\""?! If you speak ill of me, Harriet's divine punishment will strike you down!"""
st_058160_0610#0,"""Divine punishment is not something to be dealt out so freely. Besides, I must return soon."""
st_058160_0620#0,"""Return to where?"""
st_058160_0630#0,"""I have inherited my role, so I must return to that which I protect... To the world itself."""
st_058160_0640#0,"""I really shouldn't even be here before you now, you see."""
st_058160_0650#0,"""So... so you're going to disappear after all?!<br>I don't want that!"""
st_058160_0660#0,"""No, I will not disappear. I will become one with this world, and watch over its inhabitants."""
st_058160_0670#0,"""For one who was born of the void to become the foundation that supports everyone... I could not be happier."""
st_058160_0680#0,"""Harriet..."""
st_058160_0690#0,"""Do not fret, Margareta."""
st_058160_0700#0,"""Once I have grown accustomed to my role, I may visit the Divine Queen at my leisure."""
st_058160_0710#0,"""Until then, the... Divine Magic Kingdom of<br>Epicuent, was it? It will be in your capable hands."""
st_058160_0720#0,"""Wha-, fairy! Guardian! There's something weird coming out of your bodies too?!"""
st_058160_0730#0,"""Our salvation has been achieved... Is that not so?"""
st_058160_0740#0,"""...Guardian. I have already expressed all gratitude possible. So allow me to say just one more thing."""
st_058160_0750#0,"""I pray from the bottom of my heart, that we may meet again."""
st_058160_0760#0,"""Farewell, Guardian. I will always be at your side."""
