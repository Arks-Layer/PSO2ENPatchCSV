st_051050_0050#0,"""Isn't this a black hole? They're not exactly rare, but..."""
st_051050_0060#0,"""Wait, it appeared abruptly?! They're not supposed to do that!"""
st_051050_0070#0,"""Intermediate-mass black hole, okay...<br>But they can't get a good view of it? Denying observation?"""
st_051050_0080#0,"""And it's expanding way too quickly! If it keeps up this pace, it'll draw the whole universe in with it!"""
