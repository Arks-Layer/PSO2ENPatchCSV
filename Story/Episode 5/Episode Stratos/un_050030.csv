un_050030_0030#0,"""I'm terribly sorry that during our last meeting all I did was ask you about your past combat experience."""
un_050030_0040#0,"""But thanks to that, the Class I've been researching... It's been approved!"""
un_050030_0050#0,"""It's now officially registered at the Class Counter, so if you meet its requirements, you can become a hero!"""
