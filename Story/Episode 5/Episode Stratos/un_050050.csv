un_050050_0020#0,"""The excitment around Summoner finally started to die down, but then they went and authorized this \""Hero\"" Class!"""
un_050050_0030#0,"""Are they trying to hurt my feelings?! Because it's working, and I'm so very sad indeed! Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo..."""
un_050050_0040#0,"""Ignore Katori."""
un_050050_0050#0,"""This new Class was based on research that was commissioned by Huey, I hear."""
un_050050_0060#0,"""Spreading word of the new Class is ultimately a good thing for ARKS. Let me know if there's any way that I can help."""
un_050050_0070#0,"""You're just going to butt in and cut me off with a quip?! I see how it is, Saga!"""
un_050050_0080#0,"""Saga and my dear <%me>, trying to popularize Hero would be effort much better spent on MEEEE!"""

un_050050_0120#0,"""...Wait, would you two happen to be Mister Saga and Miss Katori?!"""
un_050050_0130#0,"""W-We might be... Why do you ask?!"""
un_050050_0140#0,"""I know the both of you! You're the two people in charge of the Bouncer Class!"""
un_050050_0150#0,"""You've both put so much effort into teaching people all about Bouncer! It's an honor to finally meet you!"""
un_050050_0160#0,"""Huh? Um, w... well, yes, that would be us!"""
un_050050_0170#0,"""Awesome! You're both so cool! Did you two also have a hard time when you were trying to get your Class off the ground?"""
un_050050_0180#0,"""W-Why yes, it was certainly quite a struggle, but thinking of the benefit for everyone in ARKS made it much easier!"""
un_050050_0190#0,"""Miss... Stratos, was it? I believe I heard something about you trying to spread the word of your new Class?"""
un_050050_0200#0,"""Yes! I'm very grateful that you took notice of me! That being said, I'm still far too inexperienced to be as good at this as you two..."""
un_050050_0210#0,"""Even with <%me> helping me out, things have been anything but easy..."""
un_050050_0220#0,"""There's no rush. This is something that takes time. We've also had to come to terms with that with Bouncer."""
un_050050_0230#0,"""We've had to rely on <%me>'s aid plenty of times ourselves. And we're still here today as a result."""

un_050050_0270#0,"""With my dear <%me> helping you out, your Class will be popular in no time at all!"""
un_050050_0280#0,"""Mister Saga, Miss Satori... Thank you very much!"""
un_050050_0290#0,"""If it wouldn't trouble you, would it be okay if I asked you for some advice later?"""
un_050050_0300#0,"""Of course, dear! We'll help with whatever we can!"""
un_050050_0310#0,"""...Thank you so very much! Once I finish writing this report, I'll come right back!"""
