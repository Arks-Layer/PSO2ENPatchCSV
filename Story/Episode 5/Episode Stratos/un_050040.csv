un_050040_0010#0,"""Ah, hello! Sorry for losing my composure the other day."""
un_050040_0020#0,"""But it's still going to be called Hero. The Class has already been registered under that name, after all."""
un_050040_0030#0,"""I'm the one who gave it that name. I couldn't think of anything more fitting!"""
un_050040_0040#0,"""After all, Guardians like yourself are heroes. Everyone in ARKS is a hero! I don't want anyone to forget that."""
un_050040_0050#0,"""You see, I was born on Ship 128 \""Themis\"", which was attacked by Darkers a number of years ago."""
un_050040_0060#0,"""When our Ship got attacked, I wasn't a member of ARKS--I was just a kid.<br>I was terrified of the Darkers that were roaming around the residential district."""
un_050040_0070#0,"""...I couldn't do anything but think to myself, \""Ah, so this is where I die.\"""""
un_050040_0080#0,"""But then, out of nowhere, an ARKS member showed up and wiped out this huge wave of Darkers like it was nothing."""
un_050040_0090#0,"""I just froze there, unable to even personally thank them. I stood behind them, looked<br>up at their imposing silhouette and simply thought to myself, \""That's a real life hero.\"""""
un_050040_0100#0,"""I want to be just like them. To be able to save someone--to give someone hope, just like that person did for me..."""
un_050040_0110#0,"""I named the Class \""Hero\"" precisely with those feelings in mind."""
un_050040_0120#0,"""ARKS are even more heroic than people think they are!"""
un_050040_0130#0,"""So if the name can help more people more people realize this... Well, I'd be so very grateful."""
un_050040_0140#0,"""That's why I'm gonna have to keep training suuuper SUPER hard in order to live up to the Class' name!"""
un_050040_0150#0,"""Alright! I'm feeling revitalized and fully charged! Thank you very much for having this talk with me!"""
