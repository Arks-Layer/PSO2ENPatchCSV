un_050070_0010#0,"""Ah, <%me>! Hello there!"""
un_050070_0020#0,"""Are you on a mission right now? I'm in the middle of honing my Hero fighting skills!"""
un_050070_0030#0,"""I asked Io to help out by going around and spreading information about the Hero class!"""
un_050070_0040#0,"""I'm not sure if it'll help or not... But I figured it was worth a shot!"""
un_050070_0050#0,"""It's important to get the message out about the class, but that doesn't mean I can slack off on my own training!"""
un_050070_0060#0,"""Still, even though it seems like people have heard about the Hero class... Not many people are familiar with how they fight."""
un_050070_0070#0,"""Ohh, I wonder if there's anything I could do to show it off to everyone somehow."""
un_050070_0080#0,"""Mwa-ha-haa! I have the perfect idea!"""
un_050070_0090#0,"""That sounds like... Deputy?!"""
un_050070_0100#0,"""Toh!"""
un_050070_0110#0,"""Not bad, Stratos! Tales of your deeds are spreading like wildfire! You must be hard at work."""
un_050070_0120#0,"""Many thanks!"""
un_050070_0130#0,"""<%me>. Thanks for giving Stratos a hand."""
un_050070_0140#0,"""It's obvious that she's got the spirit of a warrior, but she has a bad habit of leaping before looking. Now doesn't that sound familiar?"""
un_050070_0150#0,"""Sounds like Huey"""
un_050070_0160#0,"""Look who's talking"""
un_050070_0170#0,"""Mhmm, I knew you'd think so! I'm actually of the same opinion!"""
un_050070_0180#0,"""Huey said she reminds him of me! Wrong, wrong, wrong and and wroooong! No matter how you look at it, she's got shades of Huey in her!"""
un_050070_0190#0,"""Hmph. What, do you agree with Huey's opinion that she's similar to myself?"""
un_050070_0200#0,"""Not that I'm offended by that, but I believe she takes after him."""
un_050070_0210#0,"""By the way, what was that you said about having an idea...?"""
un_050070_0220#0,"""Oh, that's right! It's a splendid idea that will help you showcase the Hero's fighting style!"""
un_050070_0230#0,"""Stratos and <%me>. You two should fight each other."""
un_050070_0240#0,"""You'd be able to show off the new class's moves in a mock battle with a Guardian!"""
un_050070_0250#0,"""Wha-? ...Huh? HUUUUUH?!"""
un_050070_0260#0,"""Sounds like fun"""
un_050070_0270#0,"""Wouldn't that be one-sided?"""
un_050070_0280#0,"""<%me>?! I mean, but... I don't think I'd be any competition!"""
un_050070_0290#0,"""Th-That's right! I would be no match for <%me>!"""
un_050070_0300#0,"""It would still achieve your goal of showing off the Hero class. That should be good enough."""
un_050070_0310#0,"""<%me> is one incredibly tough cookie. One of the strongest ARKS has to offer."""
un_050070_0320#0,"""However, whether you're a match for them or not is up to you, Stratos."""
un_050070_0330#0,"""But if I humiliate myself, I'll drag the Hero name down with me, and nobody will ever want to be one..."""
un_050070_0340#0,"""Why are you worried about losing before you've even done anything? Have you seen the future?"""
un_050070_0350#0,"""...!"""
un_050070_0360#0,"""That's not the Stratos I know. What class are you in charge of again?"""
un_050070_0370#0,"""...You're right, Deputy! A Hero never loses heart, and never gives in!"""
un_050070_0380#0,"""<%me>! I may still be inexperienced, but I will give it my very best. ...Please allow me to spar with you!"""
