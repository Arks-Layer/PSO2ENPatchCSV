st_056110_0030#0,"""Excuse me, Marge?"""
st_056110_0040#0,"""Who the heck is Marge?! Don't abbreviate the name of the Divine Queen, blasphemer!"""
st_056110_0050#0,"""...So, what is it?"""
st_056110_0060#0,"""That Devil Castle didn't happen to be set up in advance, did it?"""
st_056110_0070#0,"""Of course not! The only Devil Castles we have are on the border. We can't afford to stick them around inside the country."""
st_056110_0080#0,"""If that's true then... That Devil Castle was summoned on the spot?"""
st_056110_0090#0,"""Wouldn't the Queen of Cuent know more about that? Just slapping them down without a summoner feels like cheating."""
st_056110_0100#0,"""No, that is far beyond even what we can do in Cuent."""
st_056110_0110#0,"""I would say that the Devil Castle just now... felt somehow different."""
st_056110_0120#0,"""Rather than being summoned..."""
st_056110_0130#0,"""It seemed more like it just... appeared?"""
st_056110_0140#0,"""The readings appeared out of nowhere. That's not how a normal summoning works at all."""
st_056110_0150#0,"""It just popped out of nowhere, with neither summoning nor summoner. How did this even happen?"""
st_056110_0160#0,"""Argh, whatever! It's those four villains anyways! They're just doing whatever they want with my country!"""
st_056110_0170#0,"""If there's a problem, just crush the source! Isn't that right, Queen of Cuent? So let's hurry up and take my country back!"""
st_056110_0180#0,"""R-right!"""
st_056110_0190#0,"""How can she act so high and mighty when she's not even doing anything to help?"""
st_056110_0200#0,"""It's only natural that I do. I am the Divine Queen, after all! If I'm not, then who would be?"""
st_056110_0210#0,"""Acting haughty is part of a Queen's duty. Never forget that, Queen of Cuent!"""
st_056110_0220#0,"""Right! Understood!"""
st_056110_0230#0,"""I really hope Harriet doesn't start taking after Marge... She'll probably be fine, I think."""
