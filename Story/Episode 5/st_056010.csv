st_056010_0020#0,"""She offered no explanation as to the details of what occurred, and<br>there was not a single tear in her eyes as she made the announcement."""
st_056010_0030#0,"""A ruler who would put her own kin to death without a flicker of hesitation.<br>In the blink of an eye she became known as \""Ice Queen\"" throughout the land."""
st_056010_0040#0,"""However, Harriet paid no mind to the derisive title.<br>Instead, she focused on her country's needs."""
st_056010_0050#0,"""The eradication of Ephimera. She believed that to be the<br>best way to repay the wishes of her deceased brother."""
st_056010_0060#0,"""Yet, those close to her could clearly<br>see that Harriet was pushing herself."""
st_056010_0070#0,"""I refuse!"""

st_056010_0090#0,"""I r-e-f-u-s-e!"""
st_056010_0100#0,"""And I insist."""
st_056010_0110#0,"""I've heard that people around the country have started calling Harriet \""Ice Queen\"", but..."""
st_056010_0120#0,"""She doesn't give off that kind of impression at all when she's bickering like this."""
st_056010_0130#0,"""Still, it's obvious she's been forcing herself to stay composed..."""
st_056010_0140#0,"""There is still much to be done to rid the world of Ephimera. I cannot afford to waste time!"""
st_056010_0150#0,"""Nor do I ask you to. It is a royal inspection tour."""
st_056010_0160#0,"""I care not about semantics! It is not a pressing issue at the moment, yes?"""
st_056010_0170#0,"""Then I shall be blunt. What you need at this moment is to rest and let your body and soul recover, Lady Harriet."""
st_056010_0180#0,"""Negotiating with our neighbours, establishing treaties, plans for storing and delivering aid. There are countless obstacles to contemplate."""
st_056010_0190#0,"""If you do not rest when you have time to, your body will suffer."""
st_056010_0200#0,"""And if something were to happen to you due to strain, how would you ever apologize to Lord Luther?"""
st_056010_0210#0,"""Invoking his name like that isn't fair, Varuna."""
st_056010_0220#0,"""I shall use whatever I must. Is that not so, Guardian?"""
st_056010_0230#0,"""Besides, do you not wish for some time to speak with the Guardian, Lady Harriet?"""
st_056010_0240#0,"""...How did you know?"""
st_056010_0250#0,"""Have you forgotten for how long I have been your aide? I can tell these things quite easily."""
st_056010_0260#0,"""And I can tell as well that right now, what you need more than anything else is rest."""
st_056010_0270#0,"""Resting is important."""
st_056010_0280#0,"""She'd be fine working day and night."""
st_056010_0290#0,"""...<%me> too?"""
st_056010_0300#0,"""She absolutely would not!"""
st_056010_0310#0,"""Harriet, please rest. If you keep working at this unreasonable pace, you'll collapse."""
st_056010_0320#0,"""...Very well. For a brief time, I shall go on this inspection tour."""
st_056010_0330#0,"""But if I am to go, I think it would be best for <%me> to accompany me."""
st_056010_0340#0,"""The stresses weighing upon me scarcely amount to what the Guardian has been enduring in destroying Devil Castles."""
st_056010_0350#0,"""If I am in need of rest, then the Guardian most certainly is as well. Is that not so, Varuna?"""
st_056010_0360#0,"""...It is indeed, my lady."""
st_056010_0370#0,"""Guardian. I place Lady Harriet into your care."""
st_056010_0380#0,"""I urge, nay implore you, to ensure that nothing happens to her."""
st_056010_0390#0,"""As her bodyguard, you mean?"""
st_056010_0400#0,"""There is that, yes... But it is my wish for you to be her confidant as well."""
st_056010_0410#0,"""With Lord Luther's passing, the only one Lady Harriet can truly rely upon now... is you."""
