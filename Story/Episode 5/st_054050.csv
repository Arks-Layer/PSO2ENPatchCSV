st_054050_0010#0,"""It's just like Luther had said, the Devil Castles have spread all over the world. They're inside Verun..."""
st_054050_0020#0,"""Hey Sina, what the hell are these guys?"""
st_054050_0030#0,"""Those are some harsh words. We've come here, rushing to save you. So if you could at least spare us some appreciation here!"""
st_054050_0040#0,"""Hmph... I never asked for your help."""
st_054050_0050#0,"""Gettemhart! I'm sorry, he's always like this..."""
st_054050_0060#0,"""This nation, Verun... What's going on here?"""
st_054050_0070#0,"""Can't you tell by just looking at it? It's war."""
st_054050_0080#0,"""War... With whom?"""
st_054050_0090#0,"""With no one... Everything surrounding us is the enemy of course."""
st_054050_0100#0,"""The weak die, the strong prevail. That is life here in Verun."""
st_054050_0110#0,"""You want to understand on what goes on? Then, follow me."""
st_054050_0120#0,"""This place... a village?"""
st_054050_0130#0,"""This is no village. This is just a gathering of survivors."""
st_054050_0140#0,"""Hey Gettemhart! Thank you for back there!"""
st_054050_0150#0,"""You just stood there like a coward. You should have done the deed, now we have more to feed."""
st_054050_0160#0,"""Haha! Never at a loss for words, are you?"""
st_054050_0170#0,"""As you've may have heard just now, tomorrow may cost one's food. It's the same everywhere else in Verun."""
st_054050_0180#0,"""Hey Gettemhart. You're still alive!"""
st_054050_0190#0,"""Ah? Oh hey kiddo. Can't even say \""thanks for protecting me\"" can't you?"""
st_054050_0200#0,"""Huh, I don't remember asking you to protect me!"""
st_054050_0210#0,"""Hehe, reminds me of a certain someone."""
st_054050_0220#0,"""Hey, don't be glaring at me! It's a true fact!"""
st_054050_0230#0,"""Melphonsina... Where's my daddy? He left with everyone to protect the village, where is he?"""
st_054050_0240#0,"""... Your father went to go somewhere far from here, to protect everyone..."""
st_054050_0250#0,"""It's ok Melphonsina... I already know... Daddy won't be coming home."""
st_054050_0260#0,"""I'm sorry..."""
st_054050_0270#0,"""Hey now, don't cry! It's the same for me! Just you wait, I'll become a very strong adult and defeat the Emperor!"""
st_054050_0280#0,"""But then, if you also get killed by the Emperor... I don't want such a thing..."""
st_054050_0290#0,"""I won't lose! I definitely will not lose! The Emperor will be defeated by me!"""
st_054050_0300#0,"""Hahaha... Don't make me laugh, kiddo. I'll be the one that crushes that damned Emperor."""
st_054050_0310#0,"""Just focus on surviving. Now, go on, return home."""
st_054050_0320#0,"""Myself and Gettemhart are forever indebted to the community here..."""
st_054050_0330#0,"""We just want to protect this place, but with the Devil Castle and the sacrifices that are made, it's an endless struggle..."""
st_054050_0340#0,"""Though, because we were able to destroy the Devil Castle that was closest to this place, things should be okay for now..."""
st_054050_0350#0,"""Eventually, business as usual will resume again. We have to defeat the Emperor to end this."""
st_054050_0360#0,"""The Devil Castles, the Demonic Soldiers... I'll destroy them all, and crush that damned Emperor... I'll stop this damned place."""
st_054050_0370#0,"""He's not very honest with himself, and I know he's rough and hard to understand, but... He wants to make it peaceful here."""
st_054050_0380#0,"""It's a civil war out here, isn't it? Have there been people who thought of overthrowing the Emperor before?"""
st_054050_0390#0,"""Yes, of course. And the Emperor has overwhelmed them all with his power."""
st_054050_0400#0,"""Because the Emperor is stronger than everyone, only wants to fight stronger foes, thus nothing else matters other than that."""
st_054050_0410#0,"""Be it people's struggle for survival, or the perishing nation... It does not matter, only the strongest matter."""
st_054050_0420#0,"""He's just fighting and nothing else? Why would he go for something that meaningless..."""
st_054050_0430#0,"""1. What a terrible tyrant."""
st_054050_0440#0,"""2. We can't just leave this alone."""
st_054050_0450#0,"""Yes, this is outrageous. We have to stop this, whether he's being controlled or not."""
st_054050_0460#0,"""Of course, that is the right thing to do. It's pitiful, we have to do something."""
st_054050_0470#0,"""Don't forget, Ephimera is here as well... There's no doubt that the influence of Darkers have spread here as well."""
st_054050_0480#0,"""ARKS goal is to destroy Darkers. We have to deal with this..."""
st_054055_0010#0,"""Meanwhile, at the capital of the Verunian Empire.<br>Schlegger, the Emperor of Verun, and his brother Elmir,<br>listened quietly to the report, regarding the status of the Devil Castle..."""
st_054055_0020#0,"""Seems like they're here... Brother. The ones who defeated the Devil Castle."""
st_054055_0030#0,"""It was the correct choice to spread these rumors after all. With a banner that those ignorant people can rally behind by, they'll likely become energized."""
st_054055_0040#0,"""Our battles between Devil Castles and Demonic Soldiers were becoming so boring. I hope that these people will be quite entertaining."""
st_054055_0050#0,"""And how strong are they... Especially this, Guardian?"""
st_054055_0060#0,"""You can't, not right now, Brother! It'll be all for naught if you devoured them now."""
st_054055_0070#0,"""You have to let them swim a little longer, to salt the meat. Or they wouldn't be very delicious when you devour them."""
st_054055_0080#0,"""Heh... Giving orders to the Emperor now? Look how big and mighty you've become."""
st_054055_0090#0,"""Very well then. Do as you wish."""
st_054055_0100#0,"""Well,if you'll excuse me.  I have an introduction to prepare."""
st_054055_0110#0,"""Guardian... Your strength, your power, how far... I cannot contain my laughter for the future pleasures that'll await me."""
st_054055_0120#0,"""Spread the war to how you see fit. This country, the people, Ephimera... Everyone in the world will be sacrificed."""
