un_058020_0010#0,"""Oh my oh my oh my oh my?! Lisa thought she saw a rare sighting, and who is it but none other than Miss Xiera!"""
un_058020_0020#0,"""Is it alright for an Administrator such as yourself to be outside the Bridge?"""
un_058020_0030#0,"""Thank you! That's the correct reaction! You really get what this means for me, Miss Lisa!"""
un_058020_0040#0,"""Lisa hasn't the smallest teensy-tiny hint of a clue as to what are you being so emotional about, but okay."""
un_058020_0050#0,"""<%me> and Matoi just don't understand how big of a deal it is for me to go outside the Bridge!"""
un_058020_0060#0,"""As an ARKS Ship Administrator, you're always with them, so isn't it kind of obvious that it wouldn't feel that different?"""
un_058020_0070#0,"""Also, you didn't answer Lisa's question."""
un_058020_0080#0,"""Ah, um, let me explain. Right now, Xiao is handling things on the Bridge, so he gave me permission to do as I please."""
un_058020_0090#0,"""The fact that Xiao has personally handling things means that something big is happening, doesn't it?"""
un_058020_0100#0,"""Uh, n-no. That's not the case at all."""
un_058020_0110#0,"""Your body temperature just fluctuated, and you broke eye contact. You're not a very good liar, Miss Xiera."""
un_058020_0120#0,"""So hey, so hey, so hey, so hey, what kind of enemy is it? Where are the bad guys?!"""
un_058020_0130#0,"""If Xiao's needs to personally take over the calculations, wouldn't that mean it's an extremely powerful opponent?"""
un_058020_0140#0,"""N-Nah, I don't know what you're..."""
un_058020_0150#0,"""Hehehehe! You're veeery easy to read."""
un_058020_0160#0,"""Is the enemy a Darker this time?! A new species like the ones on Earth?! Or perhaps could it be something... else?"""
un_058020_0163#0,"""Oh, oh, wait, it wouldn't have anything to do with that strong inner presence emanating from within you, would it?!"""
un_058020_0166#0,"""Come to think of it, there was that emergency medical check not too long ago... right?"""
un_058020_0170#0,"""P-Please stop trying to get me to spill the beans!"""
un_058020_0180#0,"""<%me>, help me out here!"""
un_058020_0190#0,"""Alright, that's enough, Lisa."""
un_058020_0200#0,"""You're on your own here, Xiera."""
un_058020_0210#0,"""Hum. Well, if it's coming from you, then Lisa will leave it at that."""
un_058020_0220#0,"""You don't have to look so uncomfortable. Lisa was able to glean enough information, so she'll let it go."""
un_058020_0230#0,"""Lisa won't tell you not to have your secrets, but she certainly doesn't want you to hide any fun topics from her, okay?"""
un_058020_0233#0,"""In particular, that power Lisa can sense from within you. That seems reeeally fun, you know? Lisa's never sensed anything like it before."""
un_058020_0236#0,"""Lisa wants you to teach her about more and more fun things like that, you know?"""
un_058020_0240#0,"""Actually, it might not be all that fun of a conversation..."""
un_058020_0250#0,"""Well, it doesn't seem like something that can be taken care of overnight, so it's fine."""
un_058020_0260#0,"""But please do let Lisa know when things are about to get fun, okay? Make sure you do that, you know? Hehehehehe."""
un_058020_0270#0,"""...I'm in an ARKS Ship, but I kind of felt like my life was in danger for a moment there."""
un_058020_0280#0,"""Interacting with people in person is a lot more intense than speaking to them over the comms, isn't it?"""
