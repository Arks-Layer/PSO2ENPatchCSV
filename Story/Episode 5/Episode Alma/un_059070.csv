un_059070_0020#0,"""Wah! Claris Claes. It's dangerous to jump on someone like that, you know!"""
un_059070_0030#0,"""If she's calling Second \""predecessor\"", then that must make her the third generation."""
un_059070_0040#0,"""Ah, I've been sneaking peeks at the databanks, so I have a general idea of what's happened."""
un_059070_0050#0,"""Still, it's pretty exciting to have both of them here at the same time."""
un_059070_0060#0,"""Now we've got all three generations standing in the same spot.<br>Isn't this a precious family moment?"""
un_059070_0070#0,"""Heeey, <%me>. What are you mumbling about to yourself over there?"""
un_059070_0080#0,"""Now that I think about it, my real name is Alma, and hers is Matoi. So what might the Third's name be?"""
un_059070_0090#0,"""Her name...?"""
un_059070_0100#0,"""Now you're doing it too?<br>What about whose name?"""
un_059070_0110#0,"""Oh, umm, Alma was just... Ah, you can't see."""
un_059070_0120#0,"""Alma?"""
un_059070_0130#0,"""I know who that is! She's the predecessor of my predecessor!"""
un_059070_0140#0,"""Oh, am I a celebrity?"""
un_059070_0150#0,"""You're doing well with your studies, Claris Claes."""
un_059070_0160#0,"""Hmhmm! My pre-predecessor is Alma, and my predecessor is Matoi."""
un_059070_0170#0,"""Now then, <%me>! Do you know what my name is?"""
un_059070_0180#0,"""You have a name?"""
un_059070_0190#0,"""Beats me"""
un_059070_0200#0,"""That's right. It might not seem like I would, considering my circumstances... But I've got one!"""
un_059070_0210#0,"""Hmhm, of course you wouldn't! It's undisclosed information, after all!"""
un_059070_0220#0,"""A while back, Casra found it while looking through some documents from the Void Organization."""
un_059070_0230#0,"""My name is Iris!"""
un_059070_0240#0,"""Iris, is it?"""
un_059070_0250#0,"""Yup! It was written like \""IRis-S,\"" so it was probably my identification code or something. It works as a name though."""
un_059070_0260#0,"""Huey even said it was a good one."""
un_059070_0270#0,"""So if I ever stop being Claris Claes, you can both call me Iris."""
un_059070_0280#0,"""Of course, I don't plan on handing off the title just yet."""
un_059070_0290#0,"""It's the name I got from my two predecessors, and I'm proud to carry on their legacy."""
un_059070_0300#0,"""She's such a strong girl. The Claris Claes we received our name from would surely be proud too."""
