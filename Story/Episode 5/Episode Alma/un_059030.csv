un_059030_0010#0,"""Hey, <%me>. Great timing. I was just thinking about calling you in."""
un_059030_0020#0,"""If you've got business with me, can you hurry it up? I've gotta do all the work our General Affairs Commander keeps wandering away from."""
un_059030_0030#0,"""You dragged <%me> and Matoi out here too, what exactly is the point of all this?"""
un_059030_0040#0,"""To discuss how to save the world.<br>Right, <%me>?"""
un_059030_0050#0,"""By the way, Sara, can you tell me how many people are present here?"""
un_059030_0060#0,"""Huh? There's <%me> and Matoi, and you and Xiera make four. Unless Quna's skulking around here somewhere."""
un_059030_0070#0,"""So? What are we here to do?"""
un_059030_0080#0,"""Nah, it's nothing. I just wanted to check up on you."""
un_059030_0090#0,"""Huh?!"""
un_059030_0100#0,"""I mean, you're still the same cute little Sara as ever."""
un_059030_0110#0,"""...I don't buy it. Avoiding the subject like just makes it more obvious you're hiding something."""
un_059030_0120#0,"""Well, you see..."""
un_059030_0130#0,"""...Oh, whatever. Now doesn't seem like the right time for you to explain it all in detail."""
un_059030_0140#0,"""Thanks for being so understanding. I'm proud to be your kin."""
un_059030_0150#0,"""You're too flattering. However, I won't forgive you if you overwork <%me> and Matoi."""
un_059030_0160#0,"""Make sure both of you go in for your regular medical checkups."""
un_059030_0170#0,"""Philia was pretty upset that you missed yours again."""
un_059030_0180#0,"""Ah... I-I'm sorry."""
un_059030_0190#0,"""Don't apologize to me, apologize to Philia.<br>...See ya later then."""
un_059030_0200#0,"""Even though Sara's related to Xiao, she can't see Alma?"""
un_059030_0210#0,"""The Photons I imbued her with must have become fully assimilated into her body. So there's no more connection."""
un_059030_0220#0,"""I think it's better that way, it means Sara's independent."""
un_059030_0230#0,"""Hmmm. Guess it's still not clear what lets people see me."""
un_059030_0240#0,"""Xiao and Xiera, copies of sorts of Xion, can see me. So can <%me> and Second."""
un_059030_0250#0,"""But, someone like Sara, who has a link to Xiao, wasn't able to..."""
un_059030_0260#0,"""I thought your connections to Xion would be similar to the Photon infusion that I provided Sara, but..."""
un_059030_0270#0,"""I guess there's something deeper with you two."""
un_059030_0280#0,"""Surely, Xion's existence persists through you even now. That's why you're able to see her."""
un_059030_0290#0,"""In other words, it's thanks to Xion that I'm able to talk to all of you here like this."""
un_059030_0300#0,"""Aside from the complicated parts, I'm thankful for that. This way, I won't be so lonely."""
