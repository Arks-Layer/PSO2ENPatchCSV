un_059010_0020#0,"""Oh! <%me> and Matoi. What an enviable friendship you two have with each other."""
un_059010_0030#0,"""Shouldn't you be in the Bridge?"""
un_059010_0040#0,"""Are you looking for someone?"""
un_059010_0050#0,"""It's not like I ALWAYS have to be in the Bridge, you know."""
un_059010_0060#0,"""But more than that, there's just not very many people to talk to up there, so I'm just taking a lil' old stroll around."""
un_059010_0070#0,"""No, no, that's not it. I've just decided to take a walk for a change."""
un_059010_0080#0,"""Besides, even if I was looking for someone and managed to find them, I wouldn't be able to talk to them. Can't do much about that!"""
un_059010_0090#0,"""Oh, right. I almost forgot that we're the only ones who can see you."""
un_059010_0100#0,"""Yeah, that's what I mean. I've been gone for 40-some-odd years now."""
un_059010_0110#0,"""Just looking around like this has been pretty fun by itself, though."""
un_059010_0120#0,"""By the way, you two. You said it yourself: nobody else can see me."""
un_059010_0130#0,"""Which means that, to everyone else, you two look like you're talking to absolutely nothing. People might start to think you're weird."""
un_059010_0140#0,"""...He's not here either, huh..."""
