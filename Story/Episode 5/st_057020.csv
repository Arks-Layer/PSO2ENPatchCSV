st_057020_0010#0,"""Having quelled the uprising in Epic, Harriet and its Divine Queen, Margareta, made their way back to Cuent."""
st_057020_0020#0,"""The purpose of their return was the signing of a peace treaty. Naturally, it pertained to Harriet's goal of eliminating the Ephimera."""
st_057020_0030#0,"""Negotiations were successful, and paved the way to the ceremonial signing. All was seemingly proceeding smoothly."""
st_057020_0040#0,"""Oh, come on. All of the details have been taken care of already, must we really hold this signing ceremony?"""
st_057020_0050#0,"""Lady Margareta. It is the proper thing to do. This is to set an example for our people as well."""
st_057020_0060#0,"""Ever since my generation, we have ceased making use of Ephimera, so we have nothing to lose from this treaty."""
st_057020_0070#0,"""I have heard that in Epic, there is a concoction made from Ephimera that can bend the wills of people... How is such a thing done?"""
st_057020_0080#0,"""Ahh, that stuff's a load of garbage. Once the effect runs out the recipient is rendered invalid. Taking control of the hearts of others is<br>forbidden, after all."""
st_057020_0090#0,"""Most importantly, our god takes great displeasure at its use. The previous Divine Queen was struck down by them for using it."""
st_057020_0100#0,"""So everyone's too afraid to make it anymore."""
st_057020_0110#0,"""Well, to be completely honest, it was my mother who was struck down, and it was by none other than myself, after receiving a divine revelation."""
st_057020_0120#0,"""I'm...not quite sure what to say, Lady Margareta."""
st_057020_0130#0,"""You're too serious, Harriet."""
st_057020_0140#0,"""My mother knew full well the price of her actions, and paid it in full. There's no need to pity her or anything."""
st_057020_0150#0,"""Isn't it similar to what happened with your<br>brother? So you need not dwell on it."""
st_057020_0160#0,"""...Alright. Thank you, Lady Margareta."""
st_057020_0170#0,"""And just how long are you going to call me<br>\""Lady\"", anyhow?"""
st_057020_0180#0,"""Ah, umm... It is important to show respect..."""
st_057020_0190#0,"""Hmm? Are you trying to say I need to show<br>more?"""
st_057020_0200#0,"""Oh, no! Not at all!"""
st_057020_0210#0,"""Look, you and I are equals. And beyond that, you are my dear friend, to whom I owe my life."""
st_057020_0220#0,"""Your dear friend..."""
st_057020_0230#0,"""Being overly respectful to your friends is actually impolite. Now, try it without."""
st_057020_0240#0,"""...I will, Margareta."""
st_057020_0250#0,"""...Excellent. There may be some insurmountable differences between our positions and countries, but we should do our best to get along."""
st_057020_0260#0,"""I'll be counting on you, Harriet."""
st_057020_0270#0,"""Hehe, they seem to be enjoying themselves. Looks like the Epic rebellion turned out alright in the end."""
st_057020_0280#0,"""All that's left is to convince Es-Ars, and the spread of Ephimera should stop. Just a little more to go."""
st_057020_0290#0,"""I don't think it'll end there."""
st_057020_0300#0,"""Flo is in Es-Ars."""
st_057020_0310#0,"""...You might be right. Flo is in Es-Ars. The child who looks just like [Double]..."""
st_057020_0320#0,"""...He is. Considering his resemblance to [Double], there's probably more to him."""
st_057020_0330#0,"""There's also the root of the problem, [Profound Darkness]. We'll have to do something about that."""
st_057020_0340#0,"""We haven't picked up any traces of it outside of the Ephimera... Where could it be hiding?"""
st_057020_0350#0,"""Lady Harriet, excuse my intrusion! I have urgent news that I must report!"""
st_057020_0360#0,"""Varuna? What has you worried so?"""
st_057020_0370#0,"""Yes, but, this isn't..."""
st_057020_0380#0,"""Is it something you don't wish for me to hear? Should I leave the room?"""
st_057020_0390#0,"""No, it is alright. I want Margareta to be present as well. Please, Varuna."""
st_057020_0400#0,"""...Yes."""
st_057020_0410#0,"""Unidentified Demons are advancing on Cuent from Es-Ars in the east... It is an invasion force."""
st_057020_0420#0,"""An invasion from Es-Ars?! What could they be after? Have they declared war, or given any reason?"""
st_057020_0430#0,"""Nothing at all... A swarm of Demons just suddenly began marching on us."""
st_057020_0440#0,"""Speak of the devil... Looks like our hunch was right."""
st_057020_0450#0,"""I will make for the border at once. Guardian, I would like you to accompany me."""
st_057020_0460#0,"""Harriet, don't do anything reckless. If things get hairy, book it right back here. A country survives so long as its ruler does."""
st_057020_0470#0,"""Yes, I will remember that well."""
