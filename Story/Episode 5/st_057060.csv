st_057060_0020#0,"""You... You're the Emperor of Verun's younger brother Elmir! You should be dead!"""
st_057060_0030#0,"""...Ha, you are well-informed. I'd expect nothing less from Es-Ars. Even we could not escape your notice."""
st_057060_0040#0,"""And yet... You knew nothing of this, did you?"""
st_057060_0050#0,"""Kuh!"""
st_057060_0060#0,"""Clarissa!"""
st_057060_0070#0,"""Flo!"""
st_057060_0080#0,"""Tch, out of the way!"""
st_057060_0090#0,"""Head of Es-Ars, Symbol of this country. It is your right to do as you wish with this land."""
st_057060_0100#0,"""Did you not desire to play more? Did you not have things you still wished to do? Then, you ought do them to your heart's content."""
st_057060_0110#0,"""You hold that power within you. And soon, you will know exactly how to make use of it."""
st_057060_0120#0,"""What...? Use my... power...?"""
st_057060_0130#0,"""That's right. The memory of how to do so should be sleeping within you."""
st_057060_0140#0,"""Why don't I help you remember?"""
st_057060_0150#0,"""Flo! Flo!"""
st_057060_0160#0,"""Afterwards, as if he were crafting clay dolls, Flo called forth Demons and Devil Castles until everything was as you saw."""
st_057060_0170#0,"""...All I could do was flee. When I saw the look on his face as he turned to me, that was all I could do..."""
st_057060_0180#0,"""Clarissa..."""
st_057060_0190#0,"""So the Emperor of Verun's younger brother,<br>Elmir, is the one who did this to Flo..."""
st_057060_0200#0,"""But I thought he was killed by Marge in Epic..."""
st_057060_0210#0,"""Did he survive?"""
st_057060_0220#0,"""Is it an impostor?"""
st_057060_0230#0,"""...I don't know. We just don't have enough information to tell whether he survived or if someone's impersonating him."""
st_057060_0240#0,"""Clarissa, what is the current situation within Es-Ars?"""
st_057060_0250#0,"""...I do not know. I was only just barely able to escape through the secret passages."""
st_057060_0260#0,"""...However, the capital is swarming with Demons. If it is not already lost, it won't be long before it is."""
st_057060_0270#0,"""The Devil Castles and Demons of Es-Ars all originate from Flo, and they are still being created as we speak."""
st_057060_0280#0,"""If left unchecked, the country will be filled to the brim with them. Filled with Demons searching for playmates."""
st_057060_0290#0,"""If we're going to stop them... Our only option is to stop their source, Flo."""
st_057060_0300#0,"""Guardian of Cuent... I beg of you, please lend us your strength."""
st_057060_0310#0,"""With that same power that saved Verun and<br>Epic, once more... Somehow... Some way..."""
st_057060_0320#0,"""...Save Flo."""
st_057060_0330#0,"""Of course."""
st_057060_0340#0,"""...Can he even be saved?"""
st_057060_0350#0,"""...It's true that we can't just leave things as they are. I have no objection to helping."""
st_057060_0360#0,"""However..."""
st_057060_0370#0,"""...I don't know. But if even the slightest possibility exists..."""
st_057060_0380#0,"""...I ask not that you save his life. Only that you save his soul."""
st_057060_0390#0,"""He sacrificed everything for his country...<br>We cannot let him destroy it."""
st_057060_0400#0,"""...How can we stop him?"""
st_057060_0410#0,"""As you know from your battles, the Demons revive at an overwhelming rate, no matter how many you slay."""
st_057060_0420#0,"""This nightmare will not end unless you strike at the heart of the problem."""
st_057060_0430#0,"""So you're saying we need to take out the core."""
st_057060_0440#0,"""Correct. There exists a passage from here that leads directly to it."""
st_057060_0450#0,"""It has a far greater chance of success than attempting to fight them head-on."""
st_057060_0460#0,"""Nevertheless, there are likely to be a far greater number of enemies lying in wait..."""
st_057060_0470#0,"""...If they are acting in accordance with Flo's desire for someone to play with, then there is a way."""
st_057060_0480#0,"""We will have Cuent's armies assault Es-Ars and draw their attention with a widespread border skirmish. They will be forced to engage in a battle of attrition."""
st_057060_0490#0,"""During that time, the Guardian will strike. They will eliminate the core, and stop the hordes from multiplying. Is that acceptable?"""
st_057060_0500#0,"""Understood."""
st_057060_0510#0,"""...It'll be dangerous."""
st_057060_0520#0,"""...Well then, we shall go our separate ways this time. I will pray for your success, and do my utmost to fulfil my own duties."""
st_057060_0530#0,"""That will be true for the both of us. Perhaps I have matured, to have not simply chosen to accompany you."""
st_057060_0540#0,"""Queen Harriet of Cuent... Noble Guardian... You have my deepest gratitude."""
