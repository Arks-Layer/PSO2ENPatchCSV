st_057150_0020#0,"""Lady Harriet, we cannot hold this position! Let us retreat to the rearguard!"""
st_057150_0030#0,"""Rgh...! If we were to do that...!"""
st_057150_0040#0,"""To lose you here would be an unforgivable travesty! Lady Harriet, I beg of you...!"""
st_057150_0050#0,"""...Very well."""
st_057150_0060#0,"""Varuna, sound the order to retreat. We will withdraw back to Cuent and hold them there."""
st_057150_0070#0,"""Ma'am! I will do so at once...!"""
st_057150_0080#0,"""Wh-What in the world?!"""
st_057150_0090#0,"""Enemies are approaching from Cuent's direction!"""
st_057150_0100#0,"""W-We'll be surrounded! To the queen's side!"""
st_057150_0110#0,"""Lady Harriet, it's too dangerous here! Reckless as it may be, we must break through! Stay as close to us as you can!"""
st_057150_0120#0,"""Why are Demons still appearing with neither Castle nor summoner around...?!"""
st_057150_0130#0,"""My lady, the lake is clear of enemies! Flee by boat! I will stay and hold them off!"""
st_057150_0140#0,"""Varuna!"""
st_057150_0150#0,"""You need not be concerned! I will return to you without fail! Go! Protect Lady Harriet!"""
st_057150_0160#0,"""Sir!"""
st_057150_0170#0,"""Varuna! Varuna!"""
st_057150_0180#0,"""There shouldn't be any Demons around here..."""

st_057150_0250#0,"""Eh...?"""
st_057150_0260#0,"""Ah... Aaah...! You have come at last, Guardian...!"""
st_057150_0270#0,"""I believed you would... I truly did...! I am so relieved... Now, the world can be as one...!"""
st_057150_0280#0,"""...Say, Guardian. Where is Xiera?"""
st_057150_0290#0,"""Heh, heheheh, gahahaha!"""
st_057150_0300#0,"""You're much sharper than I imagined. I go through all the trouble of putting on this disguise, and you won't even humor me."""
st_057150_0310#0,"""You are... Elmir?!"""
st_057150_0320#0,"""Why the surprise? You've known since long ago that I still lived, have you not?"""
st_057150_0330#0,"""Are you saying you're... immortal?"""
st_057150_0340#0,"""Hahah! Life and death have no meaning whatsoever within this world, you know."""
st_057150_0350#0,"""What are you...?"""
st_057150_0360#0,"""Ow...!"""
st_057150_0370#0,"""Your precious Guardian has been hard at work. It won't be long now before war is but a thing of the past."""

st_057150_0390#0,"""[Elder], [Loser], [Apprentice], [Double]. All Factors have been graciously returned to the earth."""
st_057150_0400#0,"""All that remains are you and I."""
st_057150_0410#0,"""So you see now, Harriet. Or should I say, Vessel of Ephimera."""
st_057150_0420#0,"""Vessel of...Ephimera...?"""
st_057150_0430#0,"""The Spirit of Ephimera, and the Vessel of Ephimera. When both pieces become one, the world too, shall become one."""
st_057150_0440#0,"""Rejoice! For your wish will finally come true! I trust you have no objections, Harriet?"""
st_057150_0450#0,"""No... You can't...! If you do that, everything will...!"""
