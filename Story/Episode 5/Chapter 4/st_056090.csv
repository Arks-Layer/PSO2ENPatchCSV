st_056090_0010#0,"""Visitors from another realm, like the Guardian? I have not received any reports of this occurring, how about you, Varuna?"""
st_056090_0020#0,"""At the very least, I can say that no such phenomena have occurred within Cuent's borders."""
st_056090_0030#0,"""I see..."""
st_056090_0040#0,"""However, I will still offer my assistance. I will contact the communities within our kingdom and ensure that nothing of the sort has..."""
st_056090_0050#0,"""Lady Harriet! Pardon the interruption!"""
st_056090_0060#0,"""What is the meaning of this?"""
st_056090_0070#0,"""M-my apologies, sir! But an important visitor has arrived to meet with her highness!"""
st_056090_0080#0,"""Get out of my way, loser, I want to talk to her myself!"""
st_056090_0090#0,"""How did... Who is this impudent child?!"""
st_056090_0100#0,"""Hold your tongue! Haven't you heard about me?!"""
st_056090_0110#0,"""You! You're Queen Harriet of Cuent, right?"""
st_056090_0120#0,"""Hmm... I was a touch nervous coming here when I heard you were called the Ice Queen, but... You look like a regular girl to me."""
st_056090_0130#0,"""And you must be the fabled Guardian!"""
st_056090_0140#0,"""Kh... It's because of you! It's your fault my kingdom's all jumbled up! You better do something to fix it!"""
st_056090_0150#0,"""What... should I do?"""
st_056090_0160#0,"""What's even going on?"""
st_056090_0170#0,"""P-please calm down! Who even are you?"""
st_056090_0180#0,"""Hmph, does no one here know anything? Very well, unplug your ears and listen up!"""
st_056090_0190#0,"""I am Margareta of Epic! From the Holy Kingdom of Epic, the one and only absolute Divine Queen!"""
st_056090_0200#0,"""Divine Queen... Margareta."""
st_056090_0210#0,"""Then, that means she's the number one most important person in the neighboring land of Epic, right?"""
st_056090_0220#0,"""Heheh, exactly! Praise me, worship me!"""
st_056090_0230#0,"""So... Why would such an important individual come all the way to the capital of Cuent without some sort of retinue?"""
st_056090_0240#0,"""Ack! That's... Er..."""
st_056090_0250#0,"""The Guardian! It's all your fault!"""
st_056090_0260#0,"""What are you even talking about?"""
st_056090_0270#0,"""I'm so confused."""
st_056090_0280#0,"""Well I mean... Cuent gets everything, they had the Sword Maiden and then they got the Guardian too. It's no fair! It's not even remotely fair!"""
st_056090_0290#0,"""So, I wanted one too... Which is why I tried summoning some kind of Guardian with a magic ritual and..."""
st_056090_0300#0,"""Well... Four Guardian-like people popped out at once... but they were all really scary and... kinda took over my country in the blink of an eye."""
st_056090_0310#0,"""Your kingdom was usurped?! How exactly do four people manage to conquer an entire kingdom from nothing?!"""
st_056090_0320#0,"""That's exactly what I'd like to know!"""
st_056090_0330#0,"""It was all I could do to evacuate the people! They just split up and took over the whole kingdom! I didn't have any choice but to flee to Cuent!"""
st_056090_0340#0,"""Four people... Could it be?"""
st_056090_0350#0,"""Anyways, Cuent is the birthplace of summoning magic, right? So take responsibility and do something!"""
st_056090_0360#0,"""If... I may, Queen Margareta. Might I inquire if you made use of Ephimera in your summoning ritual?"""
st_056090_0370#0,"""Ephimera... That creepy flower? There's no way in hell I'd ever touch such a gross thing!<br>...Though, I think the four invaders did?"""
st_056090_0380#0,"""Ah, that reminds me... Cuent was calling for the eradication of that creepy flower, weren't they?"""
st_056090_0390#0,"""As soon as my kingdom's back to normal, I'll sign off on the treaty to eradicate the stuff! How's that sound?"""
st_056090_0400#0,"""I... am unsure if this is the time for that..."""
st_056090_0410#0,"""Argh! I'm losing my mind here, someone just do something about this!"""
st_056090_0420#0,"""What do you say... Lady Harriet?"""
st_056090_0430#0,"""Ahem... If Ephimera is truly involved, then it would be unwise to turn a blind eye to the situation."""
st_056090_0440#0,"""And... It would feel wrong to."""
st_056090_0450#0,"""Y-yes, my Lady..."""
st_056090_0460#0,"""Guardian, Xiera. I intend to survey the state of Epic for myself, may I ask you to accompany me?"""
st_056090_0470#0,"""Yes, of course. I think this might be related to our problem as well..."""
