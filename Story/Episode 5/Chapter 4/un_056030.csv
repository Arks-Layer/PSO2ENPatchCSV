un_056030_0010#0,"""...Um, Lady Margareta? Are you certain it is alright for us to do something like this?"""
un_056030_0020#0,"""One hundred percent. Any respectable ruler makes it their business to go for a stroll."""
un_056030_0030#0,"""I never got the chance to show you around the first time you were here, so this is perfect."""
un_056030_0040#0,"""Oh, it's Lady Margareta. Back again already? The crops haven't grown in yet, ya know."""
un_056030_0050#0,"""Like I care about that. I'm here to show my friend around town."""
un_056030_0060#0,"""Did you say friend?!"""
un_056030_0070#0,"""That's so... How terrible for them."""
un_056030_0080#0,"""Why would you put them through that...?"""
un_056030_0090#0,"""Hope God keeps 'em strong."""
un_056030_0100#0,"""...How awful."""
un_056030_0110#0,"""Can it! Do you people even hear what you're saying?!"""
un_056030_0120#0,"""But still, to think she'd make a friend..."""
un_056030_0130#0,"""Lady Margareta, is it really true? Somebody was actually willing to befriend a mass of arrogance in human clothing?"""
un_056030_0140#0,"""You're past being rude, now you're just being mean...!<br>...But if you told me two days ago that I'd make a friend, I'd be just as surprised!"""
un_056030_0150#0,"""So then, who exactly is this friend of yours?"""
un_056030_0160#0,"""The newly crowned Queen Harriet of Cuent. Maybe you uncultured swine have heard of their famous \""Ice Queen.\"""""
un_056030_0170#0,"""Oh yeah, I think I 'ave. Cuent's cruel-hearted queen, or somethin'."""
un_056030_0180#0,"""..."""
un_056030_0190#0,"""...She doesn't look like an Ice Queen to me. Hey miss, are you cold?"""
un_056030_0200#0,"""Huh...? Ah, well, I believe the name refers to my behavior and disposition..."""
un_056030_0210#0,"""Ya don't seem nothin' like an Ice Queen to me."""
un_056030_0220#0,"""She looks like she could use some ice. This heat's gotta have her sweating buckets."""
un_056030_0230#0,"""Besides, you made friends with Lady Margareta, didn't you?"""
un_056030_0240#0,"""There's no way someone so selfless could be an Ice Queen."""
un_056030_0250#0,"""Huh...?"""
un_056030_0260#0,"""Yeah, yeah! If yer supposed to be the Ice Queen, then I can't imagine what Lady Margareta should be called!"""
un_056030_0270#0,"""Hahahah! Ain't that the truth! We'd be here all day trying to figure that out!"""
un_056030_0280#0,"""That's enough, you mongrels! You're pestering Harriet! Off with you all! Hurry along!"""
un_056030_0290#0,"""Jeez, their insolence knows no bounds!"""
un_056030_0300#0,"""...Still, I get what they mean."""
un_056030_0310#0,"""What do you mean by that?"""
un_056030_0320#0,"""Even I was wary of the whole 'Ice Queen' business right from the start."""
un_056030_0330#0,"""But meeting you confirmed it. Harriet, you're no Ice Queen or anything like it."""
un_056030_0340#0,"""Even my braindead subjects could tell. Why do you think they were talking to you so openly?"""
un_056030_0350#0,"""Is... that right?"""
un_056030_0360#0,"""It's totally right. Truly, whoever started that nickname for you is as blind as a bat."""
un_056030_0370#0,"""Lady Margareta."""
un_056030_0380#0,"""Hm? What is it, Harriet?"""
un_056030_0390#0,"""Thank you very much."""
un_056030_0400#0,"""Why're you being so formal? Oh well, I'll humor you. You're very welcome, Harriet."""
