st_056030_0030#0,"""My appearance is that of Harriet's. My mannerisms too. No one has ever doubted a single thing about me."""
st_056030_0040#0,"""But I... I do not know if I truly am Harriet."""
st_056030_0050#0,"""For that matter, am I even a human?"""
st_056030_0060#0,"""But, these things matter not to me. Whatever my nature may be, it was a strong desire for me to exist that called me here."""
st_056030_0070#0,"""Harriet was the kind of person who would work tirelessly for her country and its people. I will work hard to follow her will."""
st_056030_0080#0,"""Just as everyone wishes, I will be Harriet."""
