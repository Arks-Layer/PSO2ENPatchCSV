st_056200_0030#0,"""As such, the citizens who had been taking<br>refuge, all returned to the capital at once."""
st_056200_0040#0,"""The arrival of the Guardian and their company<br>was met with the clamoring adoration of<br>these masses."""
st_056200_0050#0,"""Their destination lay at the heart of the<br>desert: a city of sweltering, unbearable heat."""
st_056200_0060#0,"""Huzzah! I've finally returned to my palace! And my subjects have already returned as well! This is yet another chance to increase my favor!"""

st_056200_0150#0,"""Well, ya can't eat what we can't grow! Check it out, my fields are completely dried up thanks to that evacuation order! Gahahah!"""
st_056200_0160#0,"""You grew more than necessary, so God punished them! Tend to them more diligently, and offer all excess to the palace!"""
st_056200_0170#0,"""Why, it's Lady Margareta. Have you come to make a nuisance of yourself again?"""
st_056200_0180#0,"""Yep, I sure have! I'll keep coming here in God's stead until you all learn to stop blaspheming!"""
st_056200_0190#0,"""Ah! It's Lady Margareta! Run! Before she points her finger at us!"""
st_056200_0200#0,"""Hah, a futile effort! You may not have seen it, but I pointed no less than one million times just now!"""
st_056200_0210#0,"""...Now she's squaring off against children. Is she really the ruler here? All the villagers make fun of her."""

st_056200_0260#0,"""Excuse me, Lady Margareta. Are you fond of this country?"""
st_056200_0270#0,"""I hate it!"""
st_056200_0280#0,"""That was fast!"""
st_056200_0290#0,"""I mean, water is scarce and all our crops wilt. The wind's too strong, and our only impressive feature is our droughts. There's nothing here to not hate."""
st_056200_0300#0,"""...But, even still. I am its Queen."""
st_056200_0310#0,"""As often as I may mock it, it is my country. It is part of me."""
st_056200_0320#0,"""Would you look the other way while someone did as they please with your possession? Of course you wouldn't!"""
st_056200_0330#0,"""The only one fit to have their way with this country is its Divine Queen!"""
