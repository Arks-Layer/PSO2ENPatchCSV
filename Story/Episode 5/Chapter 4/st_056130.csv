st_056130_0010#0,"""Kyu kyu kyuuuu..."""
st_056130_0020#0,"""Hm, as expected of the Guardian. Miss Matoi spoke of your power over a hundred times, and yet your powers are many times greater still."""
st_056130_0030#0,"""Yet I am but a false vessel in the end. My strength pales in comparison to the might of the remaining Infernal Lords."""
st_056130_0040#0,"""The stronger the light, the greater the shadow cast... Falling here would have spared you the suffering of what lies ahead."""
st_056130_0050#0,"""Spare us your words instead, foul demon! No matter how strong the foe may be, none shall stop me from retaking my kingdom!"""
st_056130_0060#0,"""Alright, everyone! Let's hurry on to the next enemy! Epic won't save itself after all!"""
st_056130_0070#0,"""Hey. Marge."""
st_056130_0080#0,"""Come back for a moment."""
st_056130_0090#0,"""A-ahaha..."""
st_056130_0100#0,"""Miss Marge... Why don't you start explaining?"""
st_056130_0110#0,"""Well, you know how those old stories go. Enemies taking over the world, with the very cool and queenly heroine saving the day? Don't you get that sorta vibe from this?"""
st_056130_0120#0,"""I wanted to leave behind my own legend kinda, save the kingdom together with the Guardian, you know? See, our kingdom's all about religion, so everything tends to get credited to God."""
st_056130_0130#0,"""And see, he kinda said that if we summoned our own Guardian, I'd be able to do something like<br>that, so..."""
st_056130_0140#0,"""\""He\"" said that? Who're you talking about?"""
st_056130_0150#0,"""My closest advisor, the high priest. But... As soon as those four appeared, he ran for his life..."""
st_056130_0160#0,"""...So, who says we go home now?"""
st_056130_0170#0,"""W-we mustn't simply abandon her!"""
st_056130_0180#0,"""Whatever her motives may be, the influence of Ephimera is all over this... We cannot leave the people of this country to such a cruel fate."""
st_056130_0190#0,"""Yeah... And I regret what I've done. I really, truly regret it."""
st_056130_0200#0,"""I know that a tale of heroes and legends won't fill the bellies of my people. But... I was hoping to at least bolster their spirits."""
st_056130_0210#0,"""And I realize I'm the dumbest idiot to ever have a such an absurd idea..."""
st_056130_0220#0,"""But please, help me set things straight. I beg of you."""
st_056130_0230#0,"""Please raise your head, Lady Margareta. I understand your feelings all too deeply. Your only mistake was in the methods you chose."""
st_056130_0240#0,"""However, if one makes a mistake, they must correct it. Is that not so, Guardian?"""
st_056130_0250#0,"""I'll do as I must."""
st_056130_0260#0,"""We can't just abandon her."""
st_056130_0270#0,"""Well... As the [Profound Darkness] likely has some hand in this, we can't simply leave it alone. Plus, it seems like Marge's actually sorry."""
st_056130_0280#0,"""Q-Queen of Cuent! Guardian! And the fairy!"""
st_056130_0290#0,"""You're all way too nice! Don't you realize people are gonna take advantage of you?!"""
st_056130_0300#0,"""I think it's more like we're getting taken advantage of, present tense, but..."""
st_056130_0310#0,"""...Well, we're both just too dang soft hearted for our own good."""
