st_056030_0030#0,"""My appearance is that of Harriet's, my mannerisms too. No one has ever doubted a single thing about me."""

st_056030_0050#0,"""For that matter, am I even a human?"""
st_056030_0060#0,"""But, these things matter not to me. Whatever my nature may be, it was a strong desire for me to exist that called me here."""
