st_056020_0020#0,"""Harriet carried out her royal inspection across the country.<br>And by her side was the Guardian, <%me>."""
st_056020_0030#0,"""And thus, her tour arrived at its final destination in Louisa,<br>a town standing on the border between Cuent and Es-Ars."""
st_056020_0040#0,"""With its vast lake and abundant natural beauty surrounding it,<br>it is a famed destination in Cuent for those seeking respite."""
st_056020_0050#0,"""'Louisa's most notable feature is its vast lake. Thanks to the flow of water from<br>the nearby mountains, and their volcanic activity, the lake surface sometimes<br>shines with all the colors of the rainbow.'"""
st_056020_0060#0,"""'On clear days it's possible to see Castle Cuent from the lakefront.<br>The beautiful contrast between the lush green of the forests and the brilliant<br>shining white of the castle is guaranteed to steal the breath of onlookers.'"""

st_056020_0120#0,"""Wha-... Oh, not at all! I am not troubled in the slightest, I assure you."""
st_056020_0130#0,"""No, not at all! I am here to relax, naturally it would be unlikely for there to be anything troubling me, right?"""
st_056020_0140#0,"""We're not blaming you for anything, so there's no need to get so flustered. It's just hard to get your mind off these things, isn't it?"""
st_056020_0150#0,"""I know that I am supposed to be resting at present, but... I apologize, it feels wrong to be doing nothing."""
st_056020_0160#0,"""What I must do now is be strong, hold back my tears, and look forward at the future so that I may make this country... this world into a better place."""

st_056020_0200#0,"""...It is because that is what I was called forth to do here."""
