st_052090_0020#0,"""It was one of the few places in Cuent that<br>was far enough from the kingdom and the<br>war to be labeled a \""backcountry\""."""
st_052090_0030#0,"""Oh! Lady Harriet, welcome home!"""
st_052090_0040#0,"""Everyone was worried when they heard about the attacks... We're glad that you're safe."""
st_052090_0050#0,"""Lady Harriet, you must be tired.<br>We'll prepare your quarters<br>immediately. Sir Varuna and guests<br>as well, please."""
st_052090_0060#0,"""Everyone's concern for me is greatly appreciated. However, I am fine. Thanks to everyone, we're in good health."""
st_052090_0070#0,"""I must show our visitors around. Please, do not mind us, and keep working hard on your duties."""
st_052090_0080#0,"""I'm sorry for the disturbance. This is our home, home of the Cuent Militia."""
st_052090_0090#0,"""There sure are a lot of people for a militia."""
