st_053010_0020#0,"""It was so chaotic, beyond our imagination. You were right to label it a dream of the Akashic Record."""
st_053010_0030#0,"""Dreams are rather unreliable when it comes to things like that."""

st_053010_0060#0,"""Ah, sorry. I don't like this either, but I think we should do something about it."""
st_053010_0070#0,"""But it's just that this is the<br>first time, in a long time, that I<br>was able to talk to someone again.<br>It's been really enjoyable."""

st_053010_0140#0,"""Eh? But aren't you really busy, Xiera?"""
st_053010_0150#0,"""Don't worry, it's OK! Talking with others is part of my role here. Isn't that right, <%me>?"""
