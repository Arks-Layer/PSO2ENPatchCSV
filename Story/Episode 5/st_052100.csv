st_052100_0020#0,"""There aren't many who could recognize my face and name together..."""
st_052100_0030#0,"""...Unless, of course, you are a<br>spy... working for Lutz."""
st_052100_0040#0,"""Brother! Surely you jest!<br>This noble soul saved me when I was<br>pursued by his men!"""
st_052100_0050#0,"""You lack foresight, Harriet. Did you<br>never consider that this could be<br>part of a greater scheme? Perhaps to<br>follow us home, and find our<br>hideout..."""
st_052100_0060#0,"""Brother!"""
st_052100_0070#0,"""I understand, I understand.<br>Please calm down. The crown princess<br>should not raise her voice like that."""
st_052100_0080#0,"""The same goes to you,<br>my older brother."""
st_052100_0090#0,"""My claim to the throne is long past.<br>I no longer have an underlying royal<br>duty to bind my thoughts, actions, or<br>subject of research."""

st_052100_0130#0,"""Hey! Watch out!<br>What're you doing?!"""
st_052100_0140#0,"""Hmm... a fairy?<br>Just like the fabled legend..."""
st_052100_0150#0,"""Then you must be... a savior from<br>another world. Just as it has been<br>foretold."""

st_052100_0270#0,"""Oh, I'm quite serious...<br>It appears my dear sister's sore gaze, however, does not take well to my words. Very well then, we shall proceed with our more pressing concern."""
