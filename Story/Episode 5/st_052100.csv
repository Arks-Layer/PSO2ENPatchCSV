st_052100_0020#0,"""There aren't many who would know me by both face and name..."""
st_052100_0030#0,"""...Unless, of course, you are a<br>spy... working for Lutz."""
st_052100_0040#0,"""Brother! Surely you jest!<br>This noble soul saved me when I was<br>pursued by his men!"""
st_052100_0050#0,"""You lack foresight, Harriet. Did you never consider that this could be part of a greater scheme? Perhaps to follow us home, and find our hideout..."""
st_052100_0060#0,"""Brother!"""
st_052100_0070#0,"""I understand, I understand. Please calm down. The crown princess should not raise her voice like that."""
st_052100_0080#0,"""The same goes to you,<br>my older brother."""
st_052100_0090#0,"""My claim to the throne is long<br>passed. I no longer have an<br>underlying royal duty to bind my<br>thoughts, actions, or the subjects<br>of my research."""
st_052100_0100#0,"""I see! This must be what<br>Alma was talking about!"""
st_052100_0110#0,"""It's like the records of what has been have all been messed up. Since this is basically a dream, anything within the boundaries of possibility can become a reality!"""
st_052100_0120#0,"""But... Luther as Harriet's brother? This exceeds all rational notions of plausibility..."""
st_052100_0130#0,"""Hey! Watch out!<br>What're you doing?!"""
st_052100_0140#0,"""Hmm... a fairy?<br>Just like the fabled legend..."""
st_052100_0150#0,"""Then you must be... a savior from<br>another world. Just as it has been<br>foretold."""
st_052100_0160#0,"""S-so, you understand!?"""
st_052100_0170#0,"""I am the forerunner of magical research. Were I to study the ebb and flow of mana around you, it would be noticeably different. After all, you are not from our world."""
st_052100_0180#0,"""That position allowed me to lay the foundations for modern summoning spells."""
st_052100_0190#0,"""I would never have made it to that point without believing in the existence of other worlds, now would I?"""
st_052100_0200#0,"""Nevertheless, you can both fly,<br>and understand speech?"""
st_052100_0210#0,"""If you wouldn't mind, might you indulge my studious passions and become the subject of my research?"""
st_052100_0220#0,"""Even if he's in an alternate universe,<br>he's practically the same person!"""
st_052100_0230#0,"""Hey! Listen!<br>Please, help meee!"""
st_052100_0240#0,"""1. Perhaps for another time."""
st_052100_0250#0,"""2. Please don't tease her."""
st_052100_0260#0,"""Hmm... very well.<br>Now, for our primary concern..."""
st_052100_0270#0,"""Oh, I'm quite serious... It appears my dear sister's sore gaze, however, does not take well to my words. Very well then, we shall proceed with our more pressing concern."""
st_052100_0280#0,"""Allow me to explain the current<br>state of affairs regarding our<br>country, and the effects of its civil war."""
