st_058030_0010#0,"""Hurry!"""
st_058030_0020#0,"""Move it!"""
st_058030_0030#0,"""Come this way, and stay close!"""
st_058030_0040#0,"""Wha-Wha-Wha! I-It sure is busy around here. But it doesn't seem all that chaotic."""
st_058030_0050#0,"""Okay people! Everyone who's ready is going to be heading west, it's gonna be a big move! Take only the absolute essentials!"""
st_058030_0060#0,"""This city may come under attack once more. In order to keep everyone safe, we ask that you all take refuge for a time."""
st_058030_0070#0,"""Keep the line nice and orderly, and no cutting! If you have any questions, please direct them to my royal guard, and they'll be happy to help!"""
st_058030_0080#0,"""That voice... Marge?! Alisa's there too! They're at the castle, let's hurry!"""
st_058030_0090#0,"""Marge!"""
st_058030_0100#0,"""Such well-worn insolence...! You finally made it, fairy!"""
st_058030_0110#0,"""The Guardian, as well. We have been waiting for you."""
st_058030_0120#0,"""Why are you two here?"""
st_058030_0130#0,"""What are you doing here?"""
st_058030_0140#0,"""Exactly what it looks like. We're helping the citizens of Cuent evacuate."""
st_058030_0150#0,"""They might not have followed orders if it were me alone, so I enlisted the Sword Maiden's help."""
st_058030_0160#0,"""Helping them evacuate... So you know what's going on outside?"""
st_058030_0170#0,"""I haven't the foggiest. But it's obvious that it's bad. We can see that black cocoon all the way from here."""
st_058030_0180#0,"""A black liquid is spilling out from the center of it. Demons and Devil Castles are appearing from it nonstop, and the area around it is in complete disarray."""
st_058030_0190#0,"""They keep coming back no matter how many we kill, so we've set up a blockade and are using it to buy time to evacuate. The refugees are heading west."""
st_058030_0200#0,"""Epic welcomes immigrants with open arms! Even though it's a crappy place to live!"""
st_058030_0210#0,"""I will lend my blade, even though this does not concern the wicked dragon. The situation is one serious enough to warrant that."""
st_058030_0220#0,"""...The sword speaks. It is saying that this is the embodiment of calamity. That a wicked force greater than the Crimson Dragon is stirring."""
st_058030_0230#0,"""Our overeager Harriet picked now of all times to go missing, too. Which is why I've gotta do everything I can."""
st_058030_0240#0,"""If she were here, her first priority would be the safety of the citizens. So I'm prioritizing it in her stead."""
st_058030_0250#0,"""Alrighty, that should be enough to answer your question. Now I've got a question of my own."""
st_058030_0255#0,"""...Where is Harriet?"""
st_058030_0260#0,"""She's..."""
st_058030_0270#0,"""...She has been captured. Held within the black cocoon."""
st_058030_0280#0,"""Don't look at us all surprised like that. Anyone with a brain could figure it out."""
st_058030_0290#0,"""Harriet hasn't returned despite what's going on. It's obvious that something has happened to her."""
st_058030_0300#0,"""If she were hurt, you wouldn't have left her side. If she had perished, you would have simply told us. Which can only mean she has been abducted."""
st_058030_0310#0,"""What's more, you came to us first to learn about the situation. Your priority wasn't to locate her."""
st_058030_0320#0,"""Which means you already know where she was taken. And there's only one place that could be."""
st_058030_0330#0,"""...You're amazing, Marge."""
st_058030_0340#0,"""I'm not queen of the country that invented a drug to control minds for nothing."""
st_058030_0350#0,"""...I can tell you two are troubled as well."""
st_058030_0360#0,"""So as queen, I will spur you on with all my strength!"""
st_058030_0370#0,"""It is obvious what must be done!"""
st_058030_0380#0,"""Before it showed up, we were golden! Now that it's here, we're a murky brown! Therefore, we just have to get rid of it!"""
st_058030_0390#0,"""But Harriet is inside of the black cocoon..."""
st_058030_0400#0,"""Well-... Hmm, alright then. We'll leave that to you!"""
st_058030_0410#0,"""You flake!"""
st_058030_0420#0,"""Quiet, fairy! It's our only option! Whenever we're unable to proceed, the Guardian paves a path for us!"""
st_058030_0430#0,"""...I agree with the queen of Epic. The Guardian continues to make possible the impossible."""
st_058030_0440#0,"""They were able to purify the Crimson Dragon and rescue my uncle trapped within."""
st_058030_0450#0,"""You even saved me from being swallowed by the darkness."""
st_058030_0460#0,"""Your accomplishments don't stop there either."""
st_058030_0470#0,"""Ask anyone what they believe in, and they'll shoot right back with \""the Guardian\""!"""
st_058030_0480#0,"""Because they have faith in you, they support you! No matter what happens, the result will be one they believed in!"""
st_058030_0490#0,"""So you need not feel accountable, and you need not let your resolve waver."""
st_058030_0500#0,"""The responsibility for your actions lies upon my shoulders, and upon Harriet's."""
st_058030_0510#0,"""Marge..."""
st_058030_0520#0,"""Im-pu-dence! You must use my full name!"""
st_058030_0530#0,"""Guardian. For you, it is possible."""
st_058030_0540#0,"""The sword spoke as such. It says you need only bring about one of the miracles you have created time and time again."""
st_058030_0550#0,"""It is not just the sword... Even I... Alisa Landale believes so."""
st_058030_0560#0,"""Mine is a blade that fights the evils of this world. I hereby pledge an oath to support you in your quest."""
st_058030_0570#0,"""Let's rescue Harriet"""
