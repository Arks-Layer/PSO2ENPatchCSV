st_057150_0030#0,"""Rgh...! If we were to do that...!"""
st_057150_0040#0,"""To lose you here would be an unforgivable travesty! Lady Harriet, I beg of you...!"""
st_057150_0050#0,"""...Very well."""
st_057150_0060#0,"""Varuna, sound the order to retreat. We will withdraw back to Cuent and hold them there."""

st_057150_0120#0,"""Why are Demons still appearing with neither Castle nor summoner around...?!"""
st_057150_0130#0,"""My lady, the lake is clear of enemies! Flee by boat! I will stay and hold them off!"""

st_057150_0290#0,"""Heh, heheheh, gahahaha!"""
st_057150_0300#0,"""You're much sharper than I imagined. I go through all the trouble of putting on this disguise, and you won't even humor me."""
st_057150_0310#0,"""You are... Elmir?!"""
st_057150_0320#0,"""Why the surprise? You've known for a long time that I still lived, have you not?"""
st_057150_0330#0,"""Are you saying you're... immortal?"""
st_057150_0340#0,"""Hahah! Life and death have no meaning whatsoever within this world, you know."""

st_057150_0400#0,"""All that remains are you and I."""
st_057150_0410#0,"""So you see now, Harriet. Or should I say, Vessel of Ephimera."""
st_057150_0420#0,"""Vessel of... Ephimera...?"""
st_057150_0430#0,"""The Spirit of Ephimera, and the Vessel of<br>Ephimera. When both pieces become one, the world too, shall become one."""
