st_057110_0010#0,"""With Harriet at their head, the armies of Cuent were besieged by the endless flow of monsters from Es-Ars."""
st_057110_0020#0,"""Morale was high. Over and over, they struggled against the wall of overwhelming strength."""
st_057110_0030#0,"""Defeat would soon be inevitable. The soldiers were growing weary of waiting for the order to retreat."""
st_057110_0040#0,"""However, Harriet did not falter. She held true to her promise with the Guardian, believing they would succeed."""
st_057110_0050#0,"""Lady Harriet, we cannot wait any longer! We must regroup within Cuent's borders!"""
st_057110_0060#0,"""...We cannot. If we pull back now, we will be overcome! Endless reinforcements hounding us at every step!"""
st_057110_0070#0,"""T-Then we will hold them off with our border defenses...!"""
st_057110_0080#0,"""This is it, Varuna. These frontlines here are our final line of defense."""
st_057110_0090#0,"""Should these hordes pass into our borders, it would spell the end for Cuent. Therefore, we must defend it until we have breathed our last."""
st_057110_0100#0,"""Guh, they've advanced this far!"""
st_057110_0110#0,"""...Guardian. I pray you are victorious."""
st_057110_0120#0,"""This is the capital of Es-Ars. Yet we haven't seen a single person. They must have..."""
st_057110_0130#0,"""...The people of the capital have likely been wiped out. The government officials, the citizens who lived here. All of them."""
st_057110_0140#0,"""...All dead from playing with Flo."""
st_057110_0150#0,"""Killing off his countrymen is just a game to him...?"""
st_057110_0160#0,"""No, you have it backwards. They were destroyed because he played with them."""
st_057110_0170#0,"""And now Flo is searching for something new to amuse him."""
st_057110_0180#0,"""He wants to play with Cuent, with Harriet... With you, Guardian."""
st_057110_0190#0,"""You seem awfully calm."""
st_057110_0200#0,"""How do you know that?"""
st_057110_0210#0,"""Because..."""
st_057110_0220#0,"""Welcome back, Clarissa."""
st_057110_0230#0,"""You brought them like I asked. Someone for me to play with."""
st_057110_0240#0,"""Like he asked... Clarissa?! Were you...?"""
st_057110_0250#0,"""...Correct. I have already died."""
st_057110_0260#0,"""The Clarissa you see before you was created by Flo. It moves in accordance with his will."""
st_057110_0270#0,"""Flo desired a friend, and I was to bring him one. Such was my purpose."""
st_057110_0280#0,"""So it was all a trick?"""
st_057110_0290#0,"""Were you lying when you asked us to save him?"""
st_057110_0300#0,"""Well..."""
st_057110_0310#0,"""Heeeey, don't just ignore me! Go away already, Clarissa!"""
st_057110_0320#0,"""Clarissa?! What did you do to her?!"""
st_057110_0330#0,"""Hm? You wanna see Clarissa? I can make as many as you want. Watch."""
st_057110_0340#0,"""See?"""
st_057110_0350#0,"""Ah?!"""
st_057110_0360#0,"""And not just Clarissa. I've got all kinds of friends!"""
st_057110_0370#0,"""See? Isn't it amazing? I can keep on making friends to play with for forever!"""
st_057110_0380#0,"""Is this replication magic...? Or cloning...? No, it's way beyond that."""
st_057110_0390#0,"""Could he be using the information stored in the Akashic Record to do this?!"""
st_057110_0400#0,"""...'Kay, let's play! Everyone else broke too quickly and it was really boring!"""
st_057110_0410#0,"""So I asked Clarissa to go out and find me a toy that wouldn't!"""
st_057110_0420#0,"""Now I have you... So let's play lots and lots!"""
st_057110_0430#0,"""Come on and play! With both of us! We'll have so much fun together!"""
