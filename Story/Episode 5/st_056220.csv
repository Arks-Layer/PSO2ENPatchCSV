st_056220_0020#0,"""<%me>! You should be able to do it now!"""
st_056220_0030#0,"""If you cut down the Dark Falz, it should save Marge...!"""
st_056220_0040#0,"""...! Guardian, please fall back!"""
st_056220_0050#0,"""Ah?! Darkness is pouring out...from the ground?! She's still this powerful...!"""
st_056220_0060#0,"""No, something is amiss..."""
st_056220_0070#0,"""Wh-...What is the meaning of this?! Do you mean to defy me?"""
st_056220_0080#0,"""Is [Apprentice] being attacked?"""
st_056220_0090#0,"""Is she losing control?"""
st_056220_0100#0,"""We're picking up signs of Ephimera... it's interacting with her Darker Factor!"""
st_056220_0110#0,"""We can't even get close, let alone help try to help Marge...!"""
st_056220_0120#0,"""If you had a path through, you could save her, right?"""
st_056220_0130#0,"""...Harriet?"""
st_056220_0140#0,"""Guardian, I will create that path for you... The rest is in your hands."""
st_056220_0150#0,"""If Ephimera is spewing forth... Then my body should prove a fitting vessel for it!"""
st_056220_0160#0,"""Wow. Wooow... No waaay... There's seriously... Noooo way... I'm really going to look like this..."""
st_056220_0170#0,"""Pick yourself up off the ground! You're in the presence of your future self! Open your eyes to the truth, and remember it well!"""
st_056220_0180#0,"""G-get off me! This is blasphemy! There's no possible way to salvage becoming a tasteless, pompous blasphemer!"""
st_056220_0190#0,"""Come on, stop fighting"""
st_056220_0200#0,"""More importantly, where are we?"""
st_056220_0210#0,"""...I suppose this isn't the place to quarrel."""
st_056220_0220#0,"""I am, as you must know, Dark Falz [Apprentice]. A former shadow of this girl here."""
st_056220_0230#0,"""I am the future form she will take, who became a vessel of [Apprentice] and indulged in their desires over and over again."""
st_056220_0240#0,"""My vessel was lost, destroyed by you, so I was to have disappeared. However..."""
st_056220_0250#0,"""...W-well, you see. Even if you're a hideous queen, you're still me, in the end."""
st_056220_0260#0,"""And if it's true that you were merely a puppet... That you were used, and then discarded... Well, I just can't accept that."""
st_056220_0270#0,"""...Indeed. It's not in my nature to be nothing more than a puppet."""
st_056220_0280#0,"""But, you know what that means. Don't you Margareta?"""
st_056220_0290#0,"""If I am to return to you, then I will inevitably try to take control again."""
st_056220_0300#0,"""Geh! Then all this would be pointless! C-can't you do something?!"""
st_056220_0310#0,"""I will."""
st_056220_0320#0,"""I'll take [Apprentice]."""
st_056220_0330#0,"""You're going to absorb her...? Is it even possible for you to do such a thing, Guardian?"""
st_056220_0340#0,"""Frankly, that's an incredibly disturbing notion even from our point of view."""
st_056220_0350#0,"""The powers this girl possesses are one thing, but yours are on an entirely different level of strangeness. Just why are you capable of such a feat?"""
st_056220_0360#0,"""Well, I suppose that matters not. You should go back now, Margareta."""
st_056220_0370#0,"""If you don't hurry, your body and soul will become permanently separated, and you won't be able to return."""
st_056220_0380#0,"""...There's one thing I'd like to confirm."""
st_056220_0390#0,"""And that would be?"""
st_056220_0400#0,"""What is it that I lack?"""
st_056220_0410#0,"""...Who knows? That is something you'll have to figure out yourself, little one."""
st_056220_0420#0,"""...What? Do not mistake that for concern over her well-being."""
st_056220_0430#0,"""There is something I wish to do. I wish to bring my heel crashing down upon the skull of the one who dared to use me."""
st_056220_0440#0,"""I am simply choosing the path that is most likely to lead me to that goal, between taking her<br>body, and assisting you. That is all."""
st_056220_0450#0,"""That's awfully straightforward of you."""
st_056220_0460#0,"""If that's what you want."""
st_056220_0470#0,"""...! Shut up! Who do you think you're speaking to like that?"""
st_056220_0480#0,"""We have no need for any manner of fellowship. I provide my power, and you your body, for the sole purpose of pursuing our mutual goal!"""
st_056220_0490#0,"""Understood? That is all this is."""
st_056220_0500#0,"""...Enough talk already! You hurry up and return, too!"""
st_056220_0510#0,"""<%me>! Harriet! Are you two okay?!"""
st_056220_0520#0,"""...I am unharmed."""
st_056220_0530#0,"""...I'm fine too."""
st_056220_0540#0,"""What about...?"""
st_056220_0550#0,"""It looks like she's gone back to normal, but everyone else who's been possessed has..."""
st_056220_0560#0,"""...Even my brother. He was enveloped in light, and disappeared."""
st_056220_0570#0,"""Ah! Lady Margareta!"""
st_056220_0580#0,"""This is no way to say goodbye...! Can't we at least talk one one more time? Act all high-and-mighty about something!"""
st_056220_0590#0,"""<%me>?"""
st_056220_0600#0,"""Bring your face closer."""
st_056220_0610#0,"""Raise your fist."""
st_056220_0620#0,"""W-Wa-wa-wa-, Wait a sec! Are you going to transfer life energy through her mouth?!"""
st_056220_0630#0,"""Y-you can do something like that?!"""
st_056220_0640#0,"""Wha-, Wha-wha-wha-what do you think you're doing?! Rather, what were you planning on doing?! And to someone who couldn't move... Blasphemy I say!"""
st_056220_0650#0,"""<%me>? Don't tell me, you're going to forcibly resuscitate her?!"""
st_056220_0660#0,"""H-how vulgar! But, if we have no other options... I suppose you must."""
st_056220_0670#0,"""H-, Ho-ho-ho-hold up! Hitting a sleeping girl will give you bad karma for the rest of your life!"""
st_056220_0680#0,"""Er."""
st_056220_0690#0,"""Ah-, ahahaaa... G-good morning! Well, I'm going to go wash up."""
st_056220_0700#0,"""What was that for?! You're all too sensitive, I was just playing a little prank!"""
st_056220_0710#0,"""Pranks don't go that far! You even used your magic to fool us... Refund all the tears we shed!"""
st_056220_0720#0,"""I never planned on dying to begin with! I am the Divine Queen! Proxy of God! I can't die without their express permission!"""
st_056220_0730#0,"""Besides, haven't I always told you there's no need for tears? Maybe if you'd laughed instead, I really would have died."""
st_056220_0740#0,"""Well... in that case, I am glad it was merely a prank."""
st_056220_0750#0,"""Because of that, you are still here with us now."""
st_056220_0760#0,"""Y-yeah... you're right.... Rrrgh, the mood here's all wrong."""
st_056220_0770#0,"""Still, I guess there are times that call for seriousness. I am revered and worshipped, after all."""
st_056220_0780#0,"""Guardian <%me>. Xiera. Queen Harriet of Cuent."""
st_056220_0790#0,"""The country of Epic faced an unprecedented danger. Though you do not follow our teachings, you nevertheless acted on our behalf. For that, I am deeply grateful."""
st_056220_0800#0,"""...How's that? Even I can act all stuffy and queen-like!"""
st_056220_0810#0,"""...Haah, somehow that closing remark drives home that you really are you, Marge."""
st_056220_0820#0,"""What do you mean, fairy!"""
st_056220_0830#0,"""I'm saying you act nothing at all like a queen!"""
st_056220_0840#0,"""Why-you-little...!"""
st_056220_0850#0,"""Are you feeling alright?"""
st_056220_0860#0,"""Is everything okay?"""
st_056220_0870#0,"""...Yes. I, too, convinced myself that nothing bad would occur when I rushed in."""
st_056220_0880#0,"""But, it is truly incredible. I feel no adverse effects whatsoever. On the contrary, I feel quite refreshed."""
st_056220_0890#0,"""More importantly, where has the black shadow that possessed Lady Margareta gone...?"""
st_056220_0900#0,"""...At the very least, I don't sense it nearby. But considering how powerful it was, it's probably gathering somewhere to regenerate."""
st_056220_0910#0,"""There's still a lingering presence, so I'll have to increase our surveillance."""
st_056220_0920#0,"""Haa, there's so much to do. Aren't I grand, working so hard right after coming back to life?"""
st_056220_0930#0,"""Of course, I won't be going it alone. I'll be helping the two of you as well. Guardian. Queen of Cuent."""
