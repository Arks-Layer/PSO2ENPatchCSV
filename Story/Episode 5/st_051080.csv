st_051080_0110#0,"""How awful of me. Perhaps because I<br>was by myself for so long, I<br>have forgotten how to interact with others."""

st_051080_0330#0,"""It's the same Technique that<br>Luther used to stop time, right?"""
st_051080_0340#0,"""That's right. He managed to copy it<br>after doing various experiments on me."""
