st_051080_0320#0,"""That feeling... myself and<br><%me> know it all too well."""
st_051080_0330#0,"""It's the same technique that<br>Luther used to stop time, right?"""
st_051080_0340#0,"""That's right. He managed to copy it<br>from me after doing various experiments on myself."""
st_051080_0350#0,"""Oh also, Su gets really mad if claim it's<br>a technique, claming \""Don't be silly. This<br>is magic, not a technique.\"""""
