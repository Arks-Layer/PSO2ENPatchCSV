st_052050_0020#0,"""1. It was the proper thing to do"""
st_052050_0030#0,"""2. What were those things?"""
st_052050_0040#0,"""I agree with <%me>,<br>for us ARKS, this is only natural."""
st_052050_0050#0,"""I'm rather curious though,<br>regarding that Devil Castle<br>and the Buster Tower."""
st_052050_0060#0,"""I was worried about that earlier. About that Buster Tower too."""
st_052050_0070#0,"""Starting with the Devil Castle.<br>It was summoning enemies, was<br>that some kind of fortress, or<br>something else...?"""
st_052050_0080#0,"""You could say that it's both. It<br>spawns Demons indefinitely, as well<br>as capable of independent thought.<br>This is all part of the Devil Castle."""
st_052050_0090#0,"""It's brought forth into this world by<br>a Summoning Spell. It's a vile entity<br>that is forced upon this world."""
st_052050_0100#0,"""Summoning Spell?"""
st_052050_0110#0,"""Magic that is used to pull vile beasts<br>from another world."""
st_052050_0120#0,"""This world flows with Magic."""
st_052050_0130#0,"""The Mana that flows throughout the<br>atmosphere causes our technology to<br>induce a supernatural event."""
st_052050_0140#0,"""Hmm, this sounds familiar to what we<br>call Photons and Techniques."""
st_052050_0145#0,"""This is likely why we're able to<br>analyze the Buster Tower and the<br>Devil Castle so quickly; They share<br>a common trait."""
st_052050_0150#0,"""There is a limit, however, to how<br>much Mana one person is able to<br>handle. Because of which, a<br>standardized range was estabilished."""
st_052050_0160#0,"""Though, this all changed<br>when \""Ephimera\"" appeared..."""
st_052050_0170#0,"""Several decades ago, Ephimera started<br>to spread all over the world. It had<br>blossomed without ever dropping<br>a seed."""
st_052050_0180#0,"""Thus it was found to be very useful<br>as a catalyst for Magic."""
st_052050_0190#0,"""One nation specializes magic that<br>augments their strength, another<br>nation uses magic for medicinal<br>techniques, and another uses it for<br>the arcane art of proliferation."""
st_052050_0200#0,"""And our nation created<br>Summoning Magic."""
st_052050_0210#0,"""The Devil Castle is at the top of Summoning<br>Magic. It will root itself into this world<br>by consuming all of the Ephimera growing around it."""
st_052050_0220#0,"""It'll summon barriers to surround itself<br>and summon Demons to attack, while utilizing<br>powerful attacks of its own."""
st_052050_0230#0,"""No matter what Magic is used,<br>it is near impossible to break<br>through its walls."""
st_052050_0240#0,"""Once summoned, it will be impossible to summon<br>another Devil Castle due to the lack of Mana<br>and Ephimera used to summon the first one."""
st_052050_0250#0,"""Then a side wins once someone summons a Devil Castle."""
st_052050_0260#0,"""Correct. War... has changed,<br>all thanks to the appearance<br>of these Devil Castles."""
st_052050_0270#0,"""Thus, the \""Buster Towers\"" were<br>created to defeat this vile<br>Summoning Magic."""
st_052050_0280#0,"""So that was what we used<br>during that battle."""
st_052050_0290#0,"""It's a siege weapon that uses<br>the Mana in the atmosphere,<br>to destroy the Devil Barriers."""
st_052050_0300#0,"""However, it requires vast amounts of Mana to<br>even use and control them. Without using Ephimera,<br>it's impossible for us to control."""
st_052050_0310#0,"""But <%me> was able to<br>handle it with ease and defeat the<br>Devil Castle."""
st_052050_0320#0,"""Mana for Magic, its technology<br>is a lot of effort... To use its<br>power, compensation is needed."""
st_052050_0330#0,"""There's no way to use so much power<br>without a price..."""
st_052050_0340#0,"""The countless feuds between<br>each nation, the coup d'etat<br>in my own nation... It's all<br>thanks to the power of Ephimera."""
st_052050_0350#0,"""This infernal flower, its fiendish<br>nectar is what drives this world<br>insane. Our goal is to rid this world<br>of it, to return this nation...<br>Rather, the world, back to normal."""
st_052050_0360#0,"""World peace is rather grandiose...<br>But I can't really say much."""
st_052050_0370#0,"""Harriet, would you mind letting<br><%me> hold that flower?"""
st_052050_0380#0,"""Focus your strength on that flower,<br>like you would with Photons."""
st_052050_0390#0,"""Just as I expected..."""
st_052050_0400#0,"""As expected..."""
st_052050_0410#0,"""Eh, Harriet, what do you mean...?"""
st_052050_0420#0,"""It's part of the tale I was about to<br>explain before. An ancient legend<br>that has been passed down since<br>ancient times."""
st_052050_0430#0,"""It goes something like this."""
st_052050_0440#0,"""Even if the world is in despair, you must<br>not grieve. From beyond the light, a distant<br>land; A guardian will appear, guided by a spirit."""

st_052050_0490#0,"""No, \""Guardian.\"""""
st_052050_0500#0,"""Please, I beg you, lend us your<br>strength."""
st_052050_0510#0,"""Such a large and amazing story all<br>of a sudden..."""
st_052050_0520#0,"""Are you ok with this, Harriet?"""
st_052050_0530#0,"""I understand that this is from<br>folklore, but it's evident that<br>we're not of this world. Wouldn't<br>it be unwise to have faith in such people?"""
st_052050_0540#0,"""Of course, I would be on alert<br>if this were a mere fairytale."""
st_052050_0550#0,"""But you lent me your strength,<br>and you've saved me twice."""
