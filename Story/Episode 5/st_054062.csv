st_054062_0010#0,"""Welcome back, you two. Thanks to your efforts, we suffered minimal damage."""
st_054062_0020#0,"""But, Xiao. Those Darkers were..."""
st_054062_0030#0,"""We were gathering data here too. Looking at these readings, it's clear that the Darkers are being strengthened."""
st_054062_0040#0,"""The question is, why..."""
st_054062_0050#0,"""1. They're being influenced by Omega?"""
st_054062_0060#0,"""2. You've figured out a reason?"""
st_054062_0070#0,"""I cannot be certain yet, however that is a possibility we cannot ignore."""
st_054062_0080#0,"""We do not understand it yet, but I think I may be on to something."""
st_054062_0090#0,"""Could it be... the influence of Omega?"""
st_054062_0100#0,"""Our calculations do show a correlation between the Black Hole's expansion and the Darkers growing stronger."""
st_054062_0110#0,"""I guess when the Black Hole absorbs more worlds, isn't it as if the [Profound Darkness] is consuming them?"""
st_054062_0120#0,"""If we say that the [Profound Darkness] consumes what the Black Hole absorbs, it doesn't sound so far-fetched."""
st_054062_0130#0,"""The [Profound Darkness] corrupts all things, no matter their nature."""
st_054062_0140#0,"""As it consumes the food that the Black Hole sucks in, it gets stronger and stronger."""
st_054062_0150#0,"""And that also affects its children, the Darkers..."""
st_054062_0160#0,"""The situation is worse than we thought."""
st_054062_0170#0,"""The energy being absorbed by the Black Hole is huge. We won't be able to handle it."""
st_054062_0180#0,"""But before that... We first have to deal with Omega."""
