st_056060_0020#0,"""Ahh! Waahhh! A ghost appeared! It's a ghost! Do something big sis!"""
st_056060_0030#0,"""I-I am uncertain what you expect me to do."""
st_056060_0040#0,"""Where are my manners. I am the governess to the head of Es-Ars, Clarissa."""
st_056060_0050#0,"""It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance Queen Harriet of Cuent, and the Guardian."""
st_056060_0070#0,"""Clarissa...?"""
st_056060_0080#0,"""Aren't you Xion?"""
st_056060_0100#0,"""Yes, does my name hold some particular meaning to you?"""
st_056060_0120#0,"""What? My name is Clarissa. I don't have any other names."""
st_056060_0140#0,"""You have heard of the Guardian and myself, then. But, if you are the governess to the head of Es-Ars, then does that mean..."""
st_056060_0160#0,"""N-no, you're wrong! I'm not the leader!"""
st_056060_0170#0,"""Indeed... Which is why what I am about to do isn't an act of treason."""
st_056060_0190#0,"""Owwwwww!"""
st_056060_0200#0,"""What were you thinking, going out on your own?! Don't you realize how important your safety is?!"""
st_056060_0210#0,"""B-but... But I wanted to come look! It's the prettiest sightseeing spot in Cuent!"""
st_056060_0220#0,"""And if I asked if I could go, you wouldn't let me, right? So..."""
st_056060_0230#0,"""'So' that's why you came alone, then?"""
st_056060_0250#0,"""...I'm sorry."""
st_056060_0260#0,"""Very well."""
st_056060_0270#0,"""Queen of Cuent Harriet, and the Guardian, you have my gratitude for watching over Flo."""
st_056060_0280#0,"""I shall ensure this favor is repaid in the future."""
st_056060_0290#0,"""Well then, Flo, let us return at once. We must begin preparations for the ritual."""
st_056060_0300#0,"""No..."""
st_056060_0310#0,"""Excuse me?"""
st_056060_0320#0,"""I don't wanna! I won't be able to play anymore once the ceremony's done! I won't have any freedom anymore!"""
st_056060_0330#0,"""Don't be so selfish. This has already been agreed upon."""
st_056060_0340#0,"""I understand but... This is my last chance to play. At least let me have a little more time..."""
st_056060_0360#0,"""Why won't you be able to play anymore?"""
st_056060_0370#0,"""What do you mean this is your last chance?"""
st_056060_0390#0,"""He doesn't seem very happy with this at all. What are you going to make this boy do?"""
st_056060_0410#0,"""It's nothing dangerous. Flo is to become the figurehead of our nation."""
st_056060_0420#0,"""Es-Ars is a nation of commerce. If one is driven by greed, they forgo mutual benefits. If one is motivated by personal gain, they lose sight of the principal of business."""
st_056060_0430#0,"""It is for that reason that the symbol of commerce must be pure and innocent. Free from desire, separated from the people, someone who only wishes for their country and people to flourish."""
st_056060_0440#0,"""A flawless figure who governs interests and benefits, after ascending to their station through a purification ceremony."""
st_056060_0450#0,"""That sounds fine but... Aren't you robbing this boy of his freedom?"""
st_056060_0460#0,"""Yeah, yeah! I won't be able to play with anyone anymore!"""
st_056060_0470#0,"""That is why you have been allowed to do as you please until the time came."""
st_056060_0490#0,"""Are you really okay with this, Flo?"""
st_056060_0500#0,"""Queen of Cuent, this is an internal matter."""
st_056060_0510#0,"""I wish to hear Flo's thoughts, that is all."""
st_056060_0530#0,"""I wanted to play more still... But it's okay. I've decided to become the symbol of Es-Ars."""
st_056060_0540#0,"""I'll become one with the country. It's always been decided, since the moment I was born."""
st_056060_0550#0,"""That way everyone can have fun. That way everyone will be happy."""
st_056060_0560#0,"""If everyone becomes happy... If everyone can have fun..."""
st_056060_0570#0,"""No one will cry anymore... No one will have to fight anymore."""
st_056060_0590#0,"""That is what you have decided upon for yourself, then."""
st_056060_0600#0,"""Yep."""
st_056060_0620#0,"""Big sis Harriet, <%me>, little fairy."""
st_056060_0630#0,"""Thanks for playing so much with me."""
st_056060_0650#0,"""I apologize for troubling you so much recently, Guardian, Xiera. But I feel much better now."""
st_056060_0660#0,"""I would not wish to be outdone by that child's resolve. I would like to return to the kingdom at once."""
st_056060_0670#0,"""We must eliminate the root of conflict in this world, Ephimera, and restore peace to the land."""
st_056060_0680#0,"""I am positive that once we accomplish that, Flo will be able to smile happily."""
