st_056080_0010#0,"""A person who looks like Xion, huh..."""
st_056080_0020#0,"""Could that be how the Photoner who originally made contact with Xion looked?"""
st_056080_0030#0,"""There aren't any records remaining from back then so the best I can do is guess, but given the situation it seems likely."""
st_056080_0040#0,"""And she's named Clarissa too... Second, did you ever hear Clarissa speak to you?"""
st_056080_0050#0,"""Umm... I vaguely remember hearing it but... That was Xion's voice."""
st_056080_0060#0,"""I see... It was already Xion's voice when I held it too."""
st_056080_0070#0,"""It may have been named 'Clarissa', but I sure never felt any presence other than Xion's."""
st_056080_0080#0,"""That said... the Ivory Staff Clarissa clearly differs from the other Genesis Weapons."""
st_056080_0090#0,"""So the records from back then..."""
st_056080_0100#0,"""Were completely erased by Xion. With no way to recover them, though... I think she was trying to tell us it isn't necessary to..."""
st_056080_0110#0,"""Back to matters at hand, with things calming down in Omega we need to come up with our next move."""
st_056080_0120#0,"""There's still two countries left. Their names were Es-Ars and Epic, I believe?"""
st_056080_0130#0,"""They seem to be more open to communications than Verun was at least, hopefully we can settle things peacefully."""
st_056080_0140#0,"""Well, that's up to Harriet now. Until anything major happens, our Guardian here will get to have some time to relax."""
st_056080_0150#0,"""We have a big problem, partner! Yuki-nee's been kidnapped!"""
st_056080_0160#0,"""Kidnapped is a pretty harsh term. What exactly happened, Afin?"""
st_056080_0170#0,"""I don't really have any idea what happened either but... We were talking and some strange pattern suddenly appeared at her feet, and she just... vanished!"""
st_056080_0180#0,"""Aurora vanished with her too... Where have they been taken?!"""
st_056080_0190#0,"""Understood, we'll look into it right away. Afin, you comb the ship for them and report back as soon as you find anything out."""
st_056080_0200#0,"""I... Alright."""
st_056080_0210#0,"""Yucreta and Aurora, kidnapped? ...But, who would take them, how'd they even manage it, and... why?"""
st_056080_0220#0,"""Xiao, we have an emergency situation."""
st_056080_0230#0,"""Brigitta? It must be serious if an operator is contacting me directly."""
st_056080_0240#0,"""Moments ago, Aika of the Intelligence Department suddenly vanished from my sensors."""
st_056080_0250#0,"""...Suddenly? Please elaborate."""
st_056080_0260#0,"""I was in the middle of navigating for her when her signal was abruptly cut."""
st_056080_0270#0,"""I saved the logs and surrounding parameter data but... I've never seen anything like this before."""
st_056080_0280#0,"""Understood, we'll begin looking for her right away. In the meantime, can you contact the Intelligence Department for me?"""
st_056080_0290#0,"""Also, if you get any additional reports of a similar nature, please forward them to me immediately."""
st_056080_0300#0,"""Roger that. Do you... think Aika will be alright?"""
st_056080_0310#0,"""She'll be okay. The girl managed to come back after becoming a Dark Falz after all."""
st_056080_0320#0,"""It's not just Yucreta, but Aika's missing as well...?"""
st_056080_0330#0,"""Oh, I got through. Sorry <%me>, can I have a sec?"""
st_056080_0340#0,"""Did something happen?"""
st_056080_0350#0,"""Sounds like more bad news..."""
st_056080_0360#0,""" Yeah, basically. You could call it bad news for certain."""
st_056080_0370#0,"""I've just received word that an Ether-attuned individual has suddenly vanished from Earth."""
st_056080_0380#0,"""An Ether-attuned individual... You don't mean Hitsugi or Kohri, do you?"""
st_056080_0390#0,"""Nah, they're not anyone that you've ever met, Xiera. Her name is Rina Izumi... I don't suppose you've noticed anything strange on your side?"""
st_056080_0400#0,"""Rina Izumi... She's the one from Casra's report, the girl from Earth who became [Apprentice]'s host."""
st_056080_0410#0,"""I'm sorry to say we haven't received any reports about her at all on this side, Enga."""
st_056080_0420#0,"""We'll begin searching right away of course, but in the meantime can you keep looking out on the Earth side?"""
st_056080_0430#0,"""Yeah, I was planning to from the start. Something about this smells real suspect to me..."""
st_056080_0440#0,"""With this, the missing have risen to Yucreta, Aurora, Aika... And the girl from Earth, Rina Izumi."""
st_056080_0450#0,"""And the common trait they all share is..."""
st_056080_0460#0,"""They've all experienced being Dark Falz..."""
st_056080_0470#0,"""They were all hosts for [Apprentice]."""
st_056080_0480#0,"""Correct. They were each a host for Dark Falz [Apprentice] at one point."""
st_056080_0490#0,"""However there hasn't been any change on Lillipa. [Apprentice] has been perfectly calm on this side..."""
st_056080_0500#0,"""Which would mean... Something happened in Omega, then..."""
st_056080_0510#0,"""But, if it's messing things up on this side... Something about it feels different this time."""
st_056080_0520#0,"""<%me>, Xiera. I want you two to investigate, but please be careful."""
