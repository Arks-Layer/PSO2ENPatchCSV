st_062040_0180#0,"""〔Welcome back,〕〔<%me>.〕"""
st_062040_0185#0,"""〔While I am aware of the crisis facing the ARKS,〕<br>〔I am pleased to see you well.〕"""
st_062040_0190#0,"""Elder Dragonkin of Amduscia. Ro Kamits...confidant of Xiao."""
st_062040_0200#0,"""〔Indeed.〕"""
st_062040_0210#0,"""〔I can feel him within you. While I have heard tell of you, this would be our first time meeting, oracle of Xiao.〕"""
st_062040_0220#0,"""Oracle?"""
st_062040_0230#0,"""She's not his kin?"""
st_062040_0240#0,"""〔To call her kin would not be incorrect, speaking in your terms.〕"""
st_062040_0250#0,"""〔However, I believe my use of this expression will make it easier for you to understand.〕"""
st_062040_0260#0,"""So Rela and I are the same... Then, Ro Kamits, are you..."""
st_062040_0270#0,"""The same as Xiao..."""
st_062040_0280#0,"""A clone of Xion..."""
st_062040_0290#0,"""〔...Precisely. I am a clone of the Akashic Record, Planet Xion. One of the abandoned.〕"""
st_062040_0300#0,"""〔I hail from the middle period. Another clone was created alongside myself, a sibling of sorts.〕"""
st_062040_0310#0,"""〔Clones of Xion we were, but there was something each lacked from the original.〕"""
st_062040_0320#0,"""〔I lacked in calculating capabilities, and the other lacked in processing power.〕"""
st_062040_0330#0,"""〔Can you not imagine how alluring the prospect of us becoming one would have been?〕"""
st_062040_0340#0,"""〔The Photoners of the time were a fearsome force, and would stop at nothing to see it made reality.〕"""
st_062040_0350#0,"""〔They plotted to join us together and create a perfect clone of Xion... Their plan failed, of course.〕"""
st_062040_0360#0,"""〔The result was the birth of this planet. Amduscia owes its existence to their folly.〕"""
st_062040_0370#0,"""〔It was passed down in legends as the clash between the Empyreal Dragon Terioto and the Infernal Dragon Kashina. They depict the impact of the two clones.〕"""
st_062040_0380#0,"""〔However, I do not find the ordeal to have been unpleasant. I bear no grudge toward the Photoners. No such sentiments exist within me.〕"""
st_062040_0390#0,"""〔I was able to gain something that could only be gained here. I believe that is enough.〕"""
st_062040_0400#0,"""〔However, I know not how Kashina feels.〕"""
st_062040_0410#0,"""...Did Xiao tell us to come to Amduscia because he wanted you to be the new administrator...?"""
st_062040_0420#0,"""〔No, that would be of little use. My computational power pales in comparison to that of Xiao. I would be naught but an imitation.〕"""
st_062040_0430#0,"""Then, what should we do...?"""
st_062040_0440#0,"""Where is the other clone?"""
st_062040_0450#0,"""If you alone aren't enough, then..."""
st_062040_0460#0,"""〔...Kashina is sleeping. Upon our colliding, they fell into a wakeless slumber.〕"""
st_062040_0470#0,"""〔They currently lie deep within Amduscia. Supporting the underworld, nothing but a vessel.〕"""
st_062040_0480#0,"""Please. Can you tell us how to get to the place Kashina is sleeping?"""
st_062040_0490#0,"""〔...Do you intend to transfer Xiao from within yourself to Kashina?〕"""
st_062040_0500#0,"""〔Failing such a task would put not only Xiao at risk, but you, his current vessel, as well. I do not believe Xiao would desire such an outcome.〕"""
st_062040_0510#0,"""It's the only way we can bring him back. That's why he told me to come here."""
st_062040_0520#0,"""Besides... It's not in my nature to run home with my tail between my legs."""
st_062040_0530#0,"""Xiao's saved my life twice now. I want to return the favor."""
st_062040_0540#0,"""...It is necessary, in order to protect everyone."""
st_062040_0550#0,"""...Please, lend us your aid."""
st_062040_0560#0,"""Please help us."""
st_062040_0570#0,"""...Please."""
st_062040_0580#0,"""〔...What shining examples of human will.〕"""
st_062040_0590#0,"""〔...I yield to your determination. You may behold Kashina. Rela of Ko, you will act as their guide.〕"""
st_062040_0600#0,"""〔Yes,〕〔Lady Kamits!〕"""
st_062040_0610#0,"""Rela is guiding us? Will the confined caverns not pose a challenge, given her size?"""
st_062040_0620#0,"""〔Hehehe.〕〔Fear not, Quna.〕<br>〔It won't be a problem!〕"""
st_062040_0630#0,"""She shrank...?!"""
st_062040_0640#0,"""〔Changing size〕〔of the Dragoncrystals〕<br>〔that make up our bodies〕<br>〔is easy for an oracle!〕"""
st_062040_0650#0,"""〔With Rela at your side, we may communicate. Now go, to Kashina.〕"""
st_062040_0660#0,"""〔...There is something I do not understand. Why do you aid the scions of the Photoners? Is that what the original wished for?〕"""
st_062040_0670#0,"""Nah, Xion wanted something else. She wanted to save a single person."""
st_062040_0680#0,"""Saving Sara, and imparting advice here, were things I did of my own volition."""
st_062040_0690#0,"""Although, that might have all been part of Xion's plan in the first place."""
st_062040_0700#0,"""〔I now understand even less. Xiao, what is it you hope to accomplish?〕"""
st_062040_0710#0,"""You're a thick one, Kamits. I'm not looking for anything complicated here."""
st_062040_0720#0,"""But, if I had to put it into words..."""
st_062040_0730#0,"""〔For human will to surpass us... I too, wish to see such a thing.〕"""
