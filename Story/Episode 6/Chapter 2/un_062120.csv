un_062120_0010#0,"""Oho, <%me>.<br>You brought Xiao back home? Good job."""
un_062120_0020#0,"""And thanks to the Dragonkin elder, his calculating strength is even greater than before."""
un_062120_0030#0,"""Now we can put up at least some sort of fight against the Photoners."""
un_062120_0040#0,"""But even if we can match them in the intelligence war, we're still up against a force like Shiva."""
un_062120_0050#0,"""Whose side are you on... Well, even just from what I've heard about her, she sounds unbelievable."""
un_062120_0060#0,"""And she's also got those followers of hers... I wonder what their deal is."""
un_062120_0070#0,"""Oh, yeah... Those guys."""
un_062120_0080#0,"""Hm? Aurora, do you know something?"""
un_062120_0090#0,"""...Kinda. Those two seem to be victims of the Photoners."""
un_062120_0100#0,"""Victims...?"""
un_062120_0110#0,"""Yeah, at first there was only one. The ultimate vessel, designed for the purpose of containing Photons."""
un_062120_0120#0,"""That vessel contained knowledge of everything. In order to assist that vessel... two gods were created."""
un_062120_0130#0,"""They were... Mitra, Goddess of Imitation, and Varuna, God of Fidelity."""
un_062120_0140#0,"""Varuna... wasn't there..."""
un_062120_0150#0,"""That's it! I remember now... When we were summoned to Omega, that Varuna guy was there!"""
un_062120_0160#0,"""You were there too... Didn't you recognize him?"""
un_062120_0170#0,"""I was kinda preoccupied then, and I don't memorize every single guy's face."""
un_062120_0180#0,"""But, he probably recognized me. Even though I was in a different form."""
un_062120_0190#0,"""Now that you mention it, he wasn't there when we left for the capital from the southern fortress."""
un_062120_0200#0,"""He seemed the type to never leave that<br>princess's side, but he said he had business elsewhere and left. It must have been because you were there."""
un_062120_0205#0,"""Back on topic, those three were created at the same time the final Akashic Record clone was... When [Profound Darkness] was born."""
un_062120_0210#0,"""As a last ditch effort, the knowledge was removed from that ultimate vessel, and it became [Profound Darkness]'s."""
un_062120_0220#0,"""Those attendants, Mitra and Varuna, were very close to it, and they were all cast into subspace together."""
un_062120_0230#0,"""...The Photoners created them on a whim, and discarded them just as casually... That makes them victims too."""
un_062120_0240#0,"""But... We're not the Photoners. They have no fight to pick with us."""
un_062120_0250#0,"""Yeah. Even though I understand where they're coming from, I'm not going to sympathize with their cause."""
un_062120_0260#0,"""So, <%me>!<br>It's up to you to beat them to a pulp!"""
