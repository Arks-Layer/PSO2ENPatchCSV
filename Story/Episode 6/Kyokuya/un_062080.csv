un_062080_0140#0,"""It is unfathomable! To think of all the time and effort Stratos put into the Hero class..."""
un_062080_0150#0,"""...Advertising? How foolish."""
un_062080_0160#0,"""Wh-wh-wh-when did you get behind me?!"""
un_062080_0170#0,"""Any fool drawn to Phantom by pretty promises would inevitably drown in their own regret, and fall to ruin..."""
