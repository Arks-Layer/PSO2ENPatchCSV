un_062090_0010#0,"""Kyo, that was unfair! Why didn't you stop even after I asked?!"""
un_062090_0020#0,"""Hmhmhm, unfairness is a perfect fit. The path I take to reach my goals matters not... If I can force a resolution, I will."""
un_062090_0030#0,"""That's going too far... Do you not care about my feelings at all? Kyo, you... jerk!"""
un_062090_0040#0,"""...Halt. Why am I the target of a gaze as cold as absolute zero? Why do you bear such animosity towards me?"""
un_062090_0050#0,"""Kyo's in the wrong here. Isn't he? <%me>?"""
un_062090_0060#0,"""Kyo is at fault."""
un_062090_0070#0,"""You're both at fault."""
un_062090_0080#0,"""Impossible... Could I have made a mistake...?"""
un_062090_0090#0,"""Y-You're right... I'm sorry for making such a scene in public..."""
un_062090_0100#0,"""...I should explain what happened. Earlier, I headed to Amduscia for a Corrupted Dragonkin suppression."""
un_062090_0110#0,"""The monsters were extremely tough... But I intended to face them head on, fighting to the bitter end in the name of justice."""
un_062090_0120#0,"""...Foolishness. What exactly did that earn you...?"""
un_062090_0130#0,"""My allies were... gravely wounded. I was only focused on what was ahead of me. When I was attacked from behind, they covered me..."""
un_062090_0140#0,"""I had lost my focus, and I wasn't keeping up my attacks. But the enemies were struck down one by one... and the battle ended."""
un_062090_0150#0,"""Kyo had used his decay Phantom ability. Even though I told him not to..."""
un_062090_0160#0,"""What of it? Your orders were to eliminate the Dragonkin. It had nothing to do with \""justice\""."""
un_062090_0170#0,"""The fault lies with you, whose obsession with what comprises \""justice\"" caused others injury. Is that what a Hero should do?"""
un_062090_0180#0,"""T-That's... not..."""
un_062090_0190#0,"""Heroes protect people with the power of<br>\""justice\"". They never give up... That is your conviction. However, strong convictions weaken the heart."""
un_062090_0200#0,"""Could your heart endure a situation where you're faced with being unable to save a beloved one with your \""justice\""?"""
un_062090_0210#0,"""\""Justice\"" has clouded your vision... You must become capable of deciding for yourself what is correct."""
un_062090_0220#0,"""You must protect your own heart. I do not wish to bear witness to that again..."""
un_062090_0230#0,"""Kyo... don't worry. I'm not the same person I was back then."""
un_062090_0240#0,"""When I can't get by on my justice, I'll be saved by yours... I know that."""
un_062090_0250#0,"""Well then... <%me>, I apologize for causing a commotion! Until we meet again!"""
