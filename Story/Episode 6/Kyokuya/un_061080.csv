un_061080_0020#0,"""It's about the Phantom class representative, Kyokuya..."""
un_061080_0030#0,"""\""He walks too fast to catch up to\"",<br>\""He's too scary-looking to talk to\"",<br>\""I can't understand a thing he says\""..."""
un_061080_0040#0,"""...We've been getting a lot of comments like that, and people really want to know what he's like..."""
un_061080_0050#0,"""Frankly, I haven't got a clue either. I can't make heads or tails of his personality or anything from our data."""
un_061080_0060#0,"""So I thought I might ask you, or maybe Stratos since they're friends..."""
un_061080_0070#0,"""...Do you have some business with me?"""
un_061080_0080#0,"""Wagh! That was sudden! When did you get here?!"""
un_061080_0090#0,"""Phantoms lurk amidst the shadows... My \""Hearkening of Hell\"" alerted me to wicked whisperings. Gossip leads down a treacherous road."""
un_061080_0100#0,"""T-The hearkening of hell...? How can something alert you to evil gossip...?"""
un_061080_0110#0,"""What a fearsome power..."""
un_061080_0120#0,"""You mean you can hear really well?"""
un_061080_0130#0,"""None can escape the \""Hearkening\"". They can only tremble in fear..."""
un_061080_0140#0,"""Wrong. It is my \""Hearkening of Hell\""... You would do well to remember it."""
un_061080_0150#0,"""This is perfect! I'm Xiera, the ARKS Ship Administrator."""
un_061080_0160#0,"""Would you mind if I asked you a few things? I have a lot of questions that people would like answered!"""
un_061080_0170#0,"""...Do as you like."""
un_061080_0180#0,"""Thank you very much! Let's start with the first question... \""What is the Black Wolf?\"""""
un_061080_0190#0,"""...My other name. One who lurks in the darkness, waiting for the perfect moment to clamp down upon their opponent's throat... that is who I am."""
un_061080_0200#0,"""Mhmm. So it's your nickname. Why 'Black Wolf' in particular?"""
un_061080_0210#0,"""Wolves stalk their prey with a level head. Cloaked in darkness, using any means at hand. Such an image is fitting as my other name."""
un_061080_0220#0,"""U-Umm... Yeah, wolves are definitely cool... Now then, on to the next question!"""
un_061080_0230#0,"""\""You seem to like dark clothing and the shade, does that mean you don't like bright stuff?\"""""
un_061080_0240#0,"""The light... is too brilliant for me."""
un_061080_0250#0,"""...Phantoms dwell in the darkness. They are incompatible with such radiance..."""
un_061080_0260#0,"""O-Oh, I see... Okay, final question!"""
un_061080_0270#0,"""\""Please tell us what makes Phantom special!\"""""
un_061080_0280#0,"""...If Hero is \""light\"", then Phantom is \""shadow\""."""
un_061080_0290#0,"""One who lurks in \""shadow\"", using methods uncondoned by \""light\""..."""
un_061080_0300#0,"""They do not take center stage within the annals of history, but they exist nonetheless."""
un_061080_0310#0,"""Indeed, they lurk within the darkness... as if a spirit..."""
un_061080_0320#0,"""A- Ahaha...I see. 'Spirits that definitely exist' is quite the way to put it..."""
un_061080_0330#0,"""So, essentially... It's someone who does whatever they have to do to succeed. A Dark Hero!"""
un_061080_0340#0,"""...If that's alright with you..."""
un_061080_0350#0,"""...Your understanding is of no concern to me. Those who lack the resolve will suffer the Phantom's curse..."""
un_061080_0360#0,"""...I am done here. Farewell."""
un_061080_0370#0,"""That was something... He certainly has a varied vocabulary."""
un_061080_0380#0,"""But I think it makes sense if you listen closely. It's like he's saying, he'll do whatever it takes, so it's dangerous to get involved with him..."""
un_061080_0390#0,"""Hmm, it's gonna take some time before I understand him completely..."""
