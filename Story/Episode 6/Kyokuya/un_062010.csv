un_062010_0030#0,"""Whoa! You took them out like blablablam! Blink once and you'd miss it! So this is the new Phantom class!"""
un_062010_0040#0,"""But what was up with that stuff you were mumbling while you were fighting?"""
un_062010_0050#0,"""It kind of felt like you were giving them a chance to escape. Was all of that necessary...?"""
un_062010_0060#0,"""Of course it was."""
un_062010_0070#0,"""Upon reaching their ears, my \""Aria\"" renders them immobile with fear, and guides them to their impending death..."""
un_062010_0080#0,"""This \""Aria\"" of mine... It is required in order to strike down my enemies with certainty."""
un_062010_0090#0,"""Sure, but don't you do it just because it sounds cool?"""
un_062010_0100#0,"""P-Patty! You can't just say that!"""
un_062010_0110#0,"""Utter foolishness. The \""Aria\"" is an absolute necessity... As far as I am concerned."""
un_062010_0120#0,"""Mhmm, I see. So Phantoms have to say an aria when they do their fancy finishing moves."""
un_062010_0130#0,"""I didn't really understand any of it, but it sure sounded cool! Teach me about how Phantoms fight!"""
un_062010_0140#0,"""What are you saying, you idiot! You're gonna make Kyokuya mad..."""
un_062010_0150#0,"""...Very well."""
un_062010_0160#0,"""Really?!"""
un_062010_0170#0,"""Phantom is a class that fights without relying on foolish notions such as \""justice\""."""
un_062010_0180#0,"""Think only about eliminating your enemy. Pay no heed to the light, to justice, or your methods. Fear not the power of darkness."""
un_062010_0190#0,"""...Especially you, Guardian. Were an ARKS of your caliber to become a spirit..."""
un_062010_0200#0,"""It would give even the most reckless and<br>\""justice\""-blinded fool pause for thought."""
un_062010_0210#0,"""...Hmph. The spirits have spoken a bit too much... Farewell."""
un_062010_0220#0,"""Yes, yes! I wanna recite a cool \""Aria\"" too! Oh \""One who is dressed in darkness\""...!"""
un_062010_0230#0,"""They're not dressed to impress. Something like \""One who is cloaked in darkness\"" would sound much cooler..."""
un_062010_0240#0,"""...But enough about all that. What did you think of our interview with the Phantom representative, Patty?"""
un_062010_0250#0,"""The eleventh class, shrouded in a fog of mystery. They weaponize the \""Aria\"", and do whatever it takes in battle. That is the nature of the new Phantom class..."""
un_062010_0260#0,"""You're so impressionable..."""
