un_061040_0010#0,"""<%me>! Remember that weird ARKS that attacked you out of the blue...?"""
un_061040_0020#0,"""Hey, <%me>!"""
un_061040_0030#0,"""Did you hear the news? There's been a new class established!"""
un_061040_0040#0,"""Its name is... \""Phantom\""!"""
un_061040_0050#0,"""And guess what else?! The Phantom trainer is...<br>one of my friends!"""
un_061040_0060#0,"""Stratos. A Hero should not speak of Phantoms...<br>It's unbecoming."""
un_061040_0070#0,"""...Hm? So you are here too, Guardian."""
un_061040_0080#0,"""Huh? <%me>, do you know each other?"""
un_061040_0090#0,"""We are acquainted. But that reminds me, I have yet to introduce myself. My name is..."""
un_061040_0100#0,"""Kyokuya, the \""Black Wolf\"". I am the Phantom class representative. You would do well to remember that."""
un_061040_0110#0,"""Nice to meet you, Kyokuya."""
un_061040_0120#0,"""What's the \""Black Wolf\"" for?"""
un_061040_0130#0,"""You forgot the \""Black Wolf\""...<br>Engrave it upon your heart."""
un_061040_0140#0,"""Oh... has it piqued your interest? However, the hour is not yet ripe... The day will come when you will be made aware."""
un_061040_0150#0,"""Oh, right. Tell us about Phantom, Kyo!"""
un_061040_0160#0,"""My name is Kyokuya! Do not fashion me with unpleasant nicknames!"""
un_061040_0170#0,"""Whaaat, why not? I've been calling you that since we were kids. Besides, it's you..."""
un_061040_0180#0,"""...Silence. I have no intention of colluding with the \""Heroes\"" who blind themselves to truth with their justice."""
un_061040_0190#0,"""What are you saying? Heroes protect everyone's hopes and peace."""
un_061040_0200#0,"""...How foolish. Have you still not realized... that your justice is meaningless?"""
un_061040_0210#0,"""What a Phantom sees is reality. Their goals are met regardless of such trivial notions... as justice and evil."""
un_061040_0220#0,"""Ooh... you're so mean, Kyo. You used to be such a nice kid..."""
un_061040_0230#0,"""Gh... f-fine! You asked about Phantom. I will explain it to you."""
un_061040_0240#0,"""To succeed as a Phantom, one must act as though they are a \""shadow\"". Paramount to that is the concept of \""evasive action\""."""
un_061040_0250#0,"""One who has mastered such a skill becomes capable of avoiding incoming attacks and retaliating with strong counterattacks."""
un_061040_0260#0,"""Furthermore, Phantom's Photon Arts possess a hidden power to them... They must be employed accordingly with the situation."""
un_061040_0270#0,"""Let us not forget the \""decay\"". Phantom's true strength... shows itself when pitted against those suffering decay."""
un_061040_0280#0,"""Dancing among the shadows and making proper use of both sides of their offense, drowning enemies wrought with decay in fear..."""
un_061040_0290#0,"""Much like a departed spirit... That is the<br>Phantom's fighting style."""
un_061040_0300#0,"""That spits in the face of justice. Taking a strong enemy head-on in glorious battle is the only way!"""
un_061040_0310#0,"""...Guardian. Do you share Stratos's sentiments? Is justice the only ideal worth holding on to...?"""
un_061040_0320#0,"""Justice is all that matters."""
un_061040_0330#0,"""It's not necessarily the only way."""
un_061040_0340#0,"""Hmph, I see... I had thought you capable of understanding, but it seems I overestimated you."""
un_061040_0350#0,"""Ho? ...I was certain you would sympathize with Stratos, but it appears you are capable of making your own judgements."""
un_061040_0360#0,"""...Show me whether you are prepared to discard your justice and become a spirit with your actions."""
un_061040_0370#0,"""...Farewell."""
un_061040_0380#0,"""Kyo! That was all so rude... Only cowards run away!"""
un_061040_0390#0,"""<%me>... I'm really sorry about all of that..."""
un_061040_0400#0,"""We actually go way back... Back then, the three of us were all good friends... but something happened."""
un_061040_0410#0,"""Because of what happened, I... closed off my heart. I was inconsolable, and wouldn't even speak."""
un_061040_0420#0,"""Kyo tried all sorts of things to cheer me up... But nothing worked."""
un_061040_0430#0,"""I think he got fed up with me. He's acted like that ever since then... He must hate me."""
un_061040_0440#0,"""But he's really not a bad person! He might act like that... but he's really kind-hearted!"""
un_061040_0450#0,"""So... please don't think poorly of him! Excuse me!"""
un_061040_0460#0,"""<%me>. My report got interrupted, but I think you understand the situation now."""
un_061040_0470#0,"""The representative of the new \""Phantom\"" class... We can assume Kyokuya attacked you earlier to gauge your power... probably."""
un_061040_0480#0,"""You're always contributing to the development of new classes, so you must have caught his eye."""
un_061040_0490#0,"""Still, if he and Stratos are friends... Then that makes them rivals!"""
