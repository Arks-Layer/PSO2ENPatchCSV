un_062030_0010#0,"""Say, have you heard about the new class, the one called Phantom?"""
un_062030_0020#0,"""From what I've heard, they're a class that operates in the 'shadow' of the ARKS..."""
un_062030_0030#0,"""They're probably not related to Void, but it still bothers me a little. Though that's just me."""
un_062030_0040#0,"""It seems like the higher-ups see it as something necessary..."""
un_062030_0050#0,"""But I think we're better off without any ARKS involved in questionable matters."""
un_062030_0060#0,"""I became a 'shadow' voluntarily, and carried out those sorts of things... But I can't accept it."""
un_062030_0070#0,"""That road... only leads to more sorrow..."""
un_062030_0080#0,"""...Maybe it'd be easier to just ask them directly."""
un_062030_0090#0,"""Hmph, so you noticed my presence."""
un_062030_0100#0,"""Soo, just to make sure... You came all this way to listen to one of my songs, right?"""
un_062030_0110#0,"""...Do not be foolish."""
un_062030_0120#0,"""Then, I'll ask again. Why did you choose to live as a 'shadow'? There is nothing there for you but sorrow."""
un_062030_0130#0,"""This world that gave birth to Hero, the class of \""light\""... has naturally cast a \""shadow\""."""
un_062030_0140#0,"""The \""light\"" is too brilliant for me. So I have chosen to live as a \""shadow\""...<br>Whether sorrowful or not, that is for me to decide."""
un_062030_0150#0,"""So you're saying you'll be happy if you become the 'shadow' to support the 'light'...? But..."""
un_062030_0160#0,"""When the power of 'shadow' is not enough, you become swallowed whole by it... You will lose your life."""
un_062030_0170#0,"""...Impressive, Vice Commander of the Intelligence Division. It seems you are no mere figurehead."""
un_062030_0180#0,"""But I wonder whether one who flickers between \""light\"" and \""darkness\"" could prevail over one as steeped in shadow such as I..."""
un_062030_0190#0,"""...Certainly, you seem to have made great efforts to obtain that power."""
un_062030_0200#0,"""Hahahah... Efforts, you say? Do not make me laugh."""
un_062030_0210#0,"""Such nonsense... For one as naturally gifted as I, who was born to walk the path of the \""shadow\"", it is not necessary."""
un_062030_0220#0,"""Did you not seek out other paths? Following the path of the 'shadow' will lead to you hurting those close to you along the way."""
un_062030_0230#0,"""It is a path devoid of love... devoid of ever knowing the love of another. Do you truly understand that?"""
un_062030_0240#0,"""Hahah... you speak absurdity. \""Shadow\"" comes to be where the \""light\"" does not reach. The two never converge."""
un_062030_0250#0,"""Those who know only the world of \""light\"" fall deeper into despair the more they learn of the \""shadows\""... Approaching it leaves them deeply marred."""
un_062030_0260#0,"""Therefore... The \""shadow\"" has never had the capacity to love, or to be loved, from the very beginning."""
un_062030_0270#0,"""You doubt my resolve to walk this path, but I stand not at its beginning... I stand at its end."""
un_062030_0280#0,"""Your resolve and the sadness you bear...<br>Those are the root of 'shadow'."""
un_062030_0290#0,"""...I cannot begin to imagine the sadness you yourself bear..."""
un_062030_0300#0,"""But the \""shadows\"" do not suit you. You possess the power to soothe, and to grant happiness...<br>That is a \""light\"" with no equal."""
un_062030_0310#0,"""Hmph... I've said too much. Farewell."""
un_062030_0320#0,"""What's with him?! That's no way to talk to the Cipher of the Council!"""
un_062030_0330#0,"""But, I understand what he meant. He keeps people at a distance because he doesn't want to hurt them."""
un_062030_0340#0,"""Also, he might deny it, but I'm sure he works incredibly hard."""
un_062030_0350#0,"""He must have a very strong drive to want to accomplish anything no matter what it takes... Alright, I'll give him a chance!"""
