un_064090_0010#0,"""Ah... gh..."""
un_064090_0020#0,"""Have you calmed down, Luco?"""
un_064090_0030#0,"""...Now speak. What took place on that day five years ago?"""
un_064090_0040#0,"""While on a mission, I discovered an old mansion on the outskirts of the residential area. It was a splendid building, and uninhabited."""
un_064090_0050#0,"""I decided to invite the two of you there, to entertain you as guests."""
un_064090_0060#0,"""So I wrote out the invitation to both of you, asking only that you come to the mansion... I left out the reason, to keep it a surprise."""
un_064090_0070#0,"""Then, on the day of the meeting... I entered the mansion through the rear entrance, in order to remain hidden."""
un_064090_0080#0,"""Upon doing so... Numerous traps were activated!"""
un_064090_0090#0,"""Before I could even resist, I was knocked unconscious... And then dragged away by someone."""
un_064090_0100#0,"""So I do not know what occurred in the mansion after that. For when I awoke next..."""
un_064090_0110#0,"""I was on Planet Wopal, though it was not yet officially known at the time. I found myself in a Void research facility on the seafloor."""
un_064090_0120#0,"""There, I was made to fight modified lifeforms endlessly, as part of their Darker Factor experiments..."""
un_064090_0130#0,"""Void...?! They were supposed to have been dismantled three years ago. What happened to you after that...?"""
un_064090_0140#0,"""The battle data collection was completely automated. The experiments remained operational even after their dissolution. I fought and fought, right up until I was rescued..."""
un_064090_0150#0,"""Maria of the Council of Six discovered the facility while searching Wopal, and liberated me."""
un_064090_0160#0,"""However... I had been fighting the creatures used in their experiments that whole time."""
un_064090_0170#0,"""When they discovered me, my body had already absorbed a dreadful quantity of Darker Factor."""
un_064090_0180#0,"""N-No way...!"""
un_064090_0190#0,"""Maria informed me that I had very nearly turned into a Darker myself, that I would not have made it had she been any later."""
un_064090_0200#0,"""Gh... Why! Why did they subject you to that...!"""
un_064090_0210#0,"""...During my work as a maid, I learned of Void's inhumane experiments, and began to investigate them independently."""
un_064090_0220#0,"""They became aware of me at some point... Deeming me a hindrance to their plans, I was targeted."""
un_064090_0230#0,"""They must have locked you two in the mansion and set fire to it in order to destroy any evidence of their presence..."""
un_064090_0240#0,"""I was not the only one to suffer. You two were placed in a grave situation as well..."""
un_064090_0250#0,"""I am truly... very sorry..."""
un_064090_0260#0,"""Don't be! Everything was Void's fault! You didn't do anything wrong!"""
un_064090_0270#0,"""Then why did you not make any attempt to contact us after you were rescued? What have you been doing all this time?"""
un_064090_0280#0,"""My corruption levels were dangerously high, even for ARKS to handle... Or so Maria believed."""
un_064090_0290#0,"""However, there was a small chance I could be saved... They decided to take that risk. Master, do you know what I speak of?"""
un_064090_0300#0,"""Cold Sleep...?"""
un_064090_0310#0,"""Taking it easy...?"""
un_064090_0320#0,"""Correct... It was the Cold Sleep that you also made use of."""
un_064090_0330#0,"""N-No! It was the Cold Sleep that you also made use of."""
un_064090_0340#0,"""...I am told the technology was still under development, but used off the record to purge the Darker Factor."""
un_064090_0350#0,"""Tch... So even after your rescue, your fate remained uncertain as you lay dormant within darkness to recover...?"""
un_064090_0360#0,"""Correct. The Cold Sleep functioned perfectly... After three years, my purification was completed."""
un_064090_0370#0,"""After awakening, I went through rehabilitation with the intent to reunite with you..."""
un_064090_0380#0,"""But... a sudden fear gripped me."""
un_064090_0390#0,"""...Fear? Of what?"""
un_064090_0400#0,"""That you would reject me... one who was corrupted by the Darkers."""
un_064090_0410#0,"""But that was merely my own cowardice... Stratos has always told me, \""Luco is Luco\""."""
un_064090_0420#0,"""So ends my story. Could you ever find it in your hearts to forgive me?"""
un_064090_0430#0,"""Of course! You haven't done anything wrong! We don't hate you at all, right Kyo?"""
un_064090_0440#0,"""Yes... You overcame the great \""fear\"" sleeping within the depths of your own heart."""
un_064090_0450#0,"""And you trusted us... you provided an explanation devoid of falsehoods... I have no complaints."""
un_064090_0460#0,"""Thank you..."""
un_064090_0470#0,"""Once again... welcome back, Luco!"""
un_064090_0480#0,"""...Thank you! Stratos, and Kyo!"""
un_064090_0490#0,"""Hey now, you apologize too, Kyo! You said all those horrible things to Luco!"""
un_064090_0500#0,"""Hmph... I was merely offering my hospitality, to lead you to a reconciliation."""
un_064090_0510#0,"""Oh, your hospitality?! But how splendid!"""
un_064090_0520#0,"""...Huh?"""
un_064090_0530#0,"""You sought to bring an even greater happiness to others."""
un_064090_0540#0,"""You sought to ease the pain and suffering of others."""
un_064090_0550#0,"""Only someone who truly understands the spirit of hospitality and is able to carry it out... is fit to be called a Maid."""
un_064090_0560#0,"""Do not be dismayed, Kyo... the role was made for you!"""
un_064090_0570#0,"""...You are a fool."""
un_064090_0580#0,"""That's right, Luco. Kyo's a guy, so he'd be man-maid!"""
un_064090_0590#0,"""You too are a fool!"""
un_064090_0600#0,"""Hey, c'mon Kyo! Only a fool calls someone else a fool!"""
un_064090_0610#0,"""Now now... Let us all don our maidly garb, and shower everyone in our hospitality!"""
un_064090_0620#0,"""No!"""
un_064090_0630#0,"""No way!"""
un_064090_0640#0,"""Hehe... Master. Thank you for all of your help."""
un_064090_0650#0,"""Because of you, we have another chance. A chance to rebuild our friendship...!"""
