st_061070_0020#0,"""Yeah. A woman named Ludmilla."""
st_061070_0030#0,"""She seemed really absorbed."""
st_061070_0040#0,"""She seemed pretty dependable."""
st_061070_0050#0,"""Ahaha... She didn't seem like a bad person."""
st_061070_0060#0,"""Ahaha... She seemed like the type to focus hard on something, so I guess you could call her dependable."""
st_061070_0070#0,"""ARKS's most talented are nothing but quirky. Just like you two."""
st_061070_0080#0,"""However, she's the one that suggested we make them space battle-ready right away. And then she got right to work on making it a reality."""
