st_061035_0010#0,"""So, Lisa... What should we call you from now on?"""
st_061035_0020#0,"""There's nothing to change. Lisa is still Lisa, so keep calling Lisa Lisa."""
st_061035_0030#0,"""If you want Harriet, just call for her and she'll come right out."""
st_061035_0040#0,"""Lisa is correct, everyone's voices will always reach me."""
st_061035_0050#0,"""However, we are of one body. It may be an inconvenience to Lisa and everyone else, so I ask that you please forgive any trouble it causes."""
st_061035_0060#0,"""...Yeah, it'll definitely take a little while to get used to that."""
st_061035_0070#0,"""Ah, since Harriet is here, I wanted to confirm something."""
st_061035_0080#0,"""How much does the Harriet here know about what happened in Omega?"""
st_061035_0090#0,"""Do you remember what happened?"""
st_061035_0100#0,"""Are you the same Harriet from Omega?"""
st_061035_0110#0,"""...Hehe. I caused a great deal of trouble back then."""
st_061035_0120#0,"""You may think of me as the same person."""
st_061035_0130#0,"""The Harriet from Omega took over as a god, and came here."""
st_061035_0140#0,"""...I know. It may be easier to imagine it as being similar to Alma's situation."""
st_061035_0150#0,"""So you see, Guardian. I remember everything that you've done for me. More than I could possibly thank you for."""
