st_061020_0010#0,"""Alright, how should we go about dishing out the work, now that we know all of that?"""
st_061020_0020#0,"""We're completely in the dark about their battle capabilities, but the biggest issue is Shiva."""
st_061020_0030#0,"""Our power is derived from Photons. Honestly, we have no way around their ability to absorb them."""
st_061020_0040#0,"""Regarding that, we've already performed some analyses and begun countermeasures. General Affairs, your report."""
st_061020_0050#0,"""Hmm? Did you figure something out?"""
st_061020_0060#0,"""If Photons won't work, we'll hit them with physical armaments."""
st_061020_0070#0,"""We're in the final stages of our A.I.S.<br>adjustments. Mass-production should start soon, too."""
st_061020_0080#0,"""The Research Division is pulling out all the stops to get them ready in time for the next battle."""
st_061020_0090#0,"""With that out of the way, our next issue is the enemy's movements..."""
st_061020_0100#0,"""Unfortunately, we have no solid leads. Even coordinating our investigations with Xiao has not brought us any closer to being able to ascertain their location."""
st_061020_0110#0,"""I expect this is purely from our gap in technological abilities. Photon concealment and isolation were one of their specialties."""
st_061020_0120#0,"""Which means it will be difficult to predict when they'll appear... We'll have to constantly be on alert."""
st_061020_0130#0,"""Mm. The Instruction and Combat Sectors will work together to strengthen our mobilization readiness."""
st_061020_0140#0,"""There are a lot more ARKS than there used to<br>be. We should be able to double up our duties."""
st_061020_0150#0,"""So we'll have all of ARKS united in its movements."""
st_061020_0160#0,"""Um... There's something that's been bothering me."""
st_061020_0170#0,"""Shiva called <%me> the<br>\""vessel of the world\""."""
st_061020_0180#0,"""What exactly does that mean?"""
st_061020_0190#0,"""I am sorry, but not even I know the meaning behind those words."""
st_061020_0200#0,"""Still, she is targeting the Guardian for one reason or another. I believe we can say that with confidence."""
st_061020_0210#0,"""...We don't know her reason, but we can't just ignore it."""
st_061020_0220#0,"""<%me>. You'll be deployed with Matoi for a time. If the two of you are together, you should be safe."""
st_061020_0230#0,"""Every sector's gonna need to get nice and chummy with each other. And we're gonna need to step up our decision-making. We'll be fine as long as everyone works together."""
st_061020_0240#0,"""Ah, <%me>. Could you wait a sec?"""
st_061020_0250#0,"""It's about the A.I.S. remodel we mentioned<br>earlier. The person in charge of the project said they wanted to meet with you."""
st_061020_0260#0,"""Sorry to ask, but could you find some time to go meet them? I'm counting on you."""
