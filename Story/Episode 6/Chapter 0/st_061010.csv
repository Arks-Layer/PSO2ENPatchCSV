st_061010_0010#0,"""Wow, I can't remember the last time everyone showed up like this. We've even got a bunch of guests sitting in."""
st_061010_0020#0,"""Ulc, now's not the time for jokes."""
st_061010_0030#0,"""I know, I know. I was just trying to lighten the mood a little. Now then, let's begin this emergency commander meeting."""
st_061010_0040#0,"""Our topic today is the Goddess of Demise, Shiva. Let's start with what we know."""
st_061010_0050#0,"""In that case, allow me to give a basic outline."""
st_061010_0055#0,"""...I'll be going over everything, Xiao."""
st_061010_0060#0,"""Of course. If we don't make everyone aware, we can't proceed with the discussion."""
st_061010_0070#0,"""The other day, an ARKS ship was assaulted by Shiva. We believe the two people that accompanied her were Photoners."""
st_061010_0080#0,"""Photoners again... But why would they be hostile towards ARKS?"""
st_061010_0090#0,"""She was recorded as having said the following: \""I was once sacrificed for your sake.\"""""
st_061010_0100#0,"""According to our data, the [Profound Darkness] that appeared during the Photoner era was sealed away."""
st_061010_0110#0,"""We have verified this fact with Aurora. Although she did not know of Shiva personally, we know this event did occur."""
st_061010_0120#0,"""Someone they forced Photons on, and used as bait to seal [Profound Darkness] away in subspace... A sacrifice. And now they've come back?"""
st_061010_0130#0,"""If we are to believe her words, yes. As for whether that is the truth... Why don't we ask those who crossed blades with her?"""
st_061010_0140#0,"""I felt an unusual power."""
st_061010_0150#0,"""..."""
st_061010_0160#0,"""It wasn't just that Shiva girl. The two that were with her stood out too. I agree that they're Photoners."""
st_061010_0170#0,"""However, Shiva was far different still. Our attacks wouldn't connect with her in the<br>slightest."""
st_061010_0180#0,"""...It was weird. Almost like she was absorbing our blows completely."""
st_061010_0190#0,"""That's right. They were made to be like that."""
st_061010_0200#0,"""Lisa, what do you mean \""like that\""?"""
st_061010_0210#0,"""Lisa means being able to absorb all of a<br>Photoner's Photons. Can you imagine just how much that would be?"""
st_061010_0220#0,"""Lisa has seen both, and if you ask her, you're quite the strange ones too."""
st_061010_0230#0,"""That's an interesting way of putting it... Lisa, just how much do you know about all of this?"""
st_061010_0240#0,"""I can provide an explanation for that. Lisa, may I take control?"""
st_061010_0250#0,"""Yes yes yes, take over. Wake Lisa up if you need to fight."""
st_061010_0260#0,"""Allow me to introduce myself once more. I am Harriet. I am what you would call a Photoner."""
st_061010_0270#0,"""<%me>. We have met each other once before. Do you recall?"""
st_061010_0280#0,"""In Kuron...?"""
st_061010_0290#0,"""When Matoi disappeared...?"""
st_061010_0300#0,"""Yes. It was quite the surprise back then."""
st_061010_0310#0,"""At that time, I was nothing more than a residual notion."""
st_061010_0320#0,"""I had no awareness of myself as Harriet, and did not possess the same will I do now."""
st_061010_0330#0,"""Speaking to you then was all I could manage... I am glad things turned out for the better."""
st_061010_0340#0,"""...Shiva and I are a pair, of sorts. I am able to speak with you all here precisely because she has appeared."""
st_061010_0350#0,"""So, what, are you saying you're related to her somehow?"""
st_061010_0360#0,"""A soul that was never meant to be, dwelling within a mere vessel. That is I. Harriet, an artificial existence."""
st_061010_0370#0,"""A vessel for Photons... for [Profound Darkness], the final existence that took everything within itself. That is Shiva, Goddess of Demise."""
st_061010_0380#0,"""Our connection is both deep, yet fleeting."""
st_061010_0390#0,"""Civilization was approaching its end in the twilight of the Photoner era."""
st_061010_0400#0,"""Society valued only the manipulation of Photons. Physical bodies, which were easily<br>replaceable, had lost their value."""
st_061010_0410#0,"""Yet the Photoners could not surmise any existence beyond that of physical bodies. What they desired was the ultimate vessel."""
st_061010_0420#0,"""...There was a certain researcher. He treated the vessel he created not as a vessel, but as another human being."""
st_061010_0430#0,"""He would converse with the silent shell day after day, until it eventually grew a heart, and even awakened to the power of Photons."""
st_061010_0440#0,"""These phenomena were the fruits of his research. A power that stood above all else. An unparalleled power."""
st_061010_0450#0,"""...The researcher was overjoyed. It was not simply a clone, but its own unique existence. A being that could rival the Akashic Record."""
st_061010_0460#0,"""However, the final clone of the Akashic Record... [Profound Darkness] was born around that same time."""
st_061010_0470#0,"""A vessel with the appropriate power was needed in order to seal it and stop its rampage. A vessel that was equal to the Akashic Record. That vessel was myself."""
st_061010_0480#0,"""But a heart was not necessary. My soul... my heart was ripped out, and replaced with Photons."""
st_061010_0490#0,"""Within that shell was born the desire to control all Photons. It became the Goddess of Demise, Shiva."""
