st_061050_0040#0,"""Oh, right right right!"""
st_061050_0050#0,"""Uhh..."""
st_061050_0060#0,"""Aagh that won't work, it'll screw up their endurance... Oh, but then I can just use that..."""
st_061050_0070#0,"""Bleagh! What's wrong? What happened?"""
st_061050_0080#0,"""Hello."""
st_061050_0090#0,"""Are you in charge of the A.I.S. project?"""
st_061050_0100#0,"""Hm? Hmmmmm? Ahhhh, I see! Good thing I asked!"""
st_061050_0110#0,"""Welcome, welcome! How do you do? I'm Ludmilla of the Research Division. It's great to finally meet you, Guardians."""
st_061050_0120#0,"""This is a bit sudden but I'd like to start the operation training and adjustments right away. We might need them at any time."""
st_061050_0130#0,"""H-Hold on, Ludmilla. What are you talking about?"""
st_061050_0140#0,"""What else? The A.I.S., of course."""
st_061050_0150#0,"""They left me in charge of revamping them. I've already got the basics bits put together. They'll even be able to fight in space."""
st_061050_0170#0,"""But either way, right now they're for emergency response. I'm still worried about some of the<br>all-purpose parts. That's why I need live data."""

st_061050_0200#0,"""They should function well regardless of the pilot, so maybe I should add some modules and make it easier to control."""
st_061050_0210#0,"""Would the average grunt be able to fight if I jack up the output? ...Their bodies probably wouldn't be able to handle it."""
st_061050_0220#0,"""Maybe if we fortified the cockpit safeguard? I've gotta run some calculations on what that'll cost."""
st_061050_0230#0,"""Live data... So we just have to move around? <br>...I'm not very comfortable piloting them."""
st_061050_0240#0,"""That's right. I've heard that <%me> made good use of the A.I.S. while fighting Apprentice."""
