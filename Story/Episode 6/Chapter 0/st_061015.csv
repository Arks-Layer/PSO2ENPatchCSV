st_061010_0510#0,"""Now, she has once again returned to this<br>universe... And, as the researcher predicted, as an enemy to all."""
st_061010_0520#0,"""...Harriet. Why are you here? What is your relation to Lisa?"""
st_061010_0530#0,"""Without my vessel, I was doomed to fade away. The Akashic Record rescued me from that fate."""
st_061010_0540#0,"""It granted my soul a new vessel born of its own oceans... a Genesis Weapon."""
st_061010_0550#0,"""The first of its kind. That is what I am now."""
st_061010_0560#0,"""And you already know all about what Lisa is,<br>don't you?"""
st_061010_0570#0,"""Lisa was the subject of an experiment. Alongside flesh bodies, suited for Photons, secret research was being done on mechanical lifeforms."""
st_061010_0580#0,"""Those are what everyone calls \""Casts\"" now. Lisa was the very first one. Get it? Of course you do."""
st_061010_0590#0,"""But because Lisa was the very first, Lisa was veeeeery unbalanced. Very and truly unstable."""
st_061010_0600#0,"""A Lisa without a stable soul, and a Harriet without a stable vessel. The two put together become kind of balanced."""
st_061010_0610#0,"""Although, Harriet was asleep until just now, without any form or powers or anything."""
st_061010_0620#0,"""...It is as Lisa says. I only awakened due to the events that took place in Omega."""
st_061010_0630#0,"""My soul was saved and inherited godhood, and came here... That is where we now stand."""
st_061010_0640#0,"""I have spent a great deal of time as a weapon at Lisa's side."""
st_061010_0650#0,"""The appearance of Dark Falz... The fall of the Photoners... The birth of ARKS, all the way to the present..."""
st_061010_0660#0,"""I have witnessed it all."""
st_061010_0670#0,"""...Why did you stay silent all this time? If you'd said something, we could have come up with some sort of plan."""

st_061010_0700#0,"""Hehehehehe. Do you see, Commander?"""
st_061010_0710#0,"""To Lisa, ARKS and the Photoners have been doing the same thing."""
st_061010_0720#0,"""Which means they'll eventually follow the same history. So Lisa decided they should kill and kill and kill each other until they all died off."""
st_061010_0730#0,"""...Until Lisa met you."""
st_061010_0740#0,"""<%me>. You made such an effort just to save one person, and ARKS supported your endeavor."""
st_061010_0750#0,"""Even in a strange and unknown land, you fought for the sake of one who wished to be saved."""
st_061010_0760#0,"""...I hate Darkers. I hate Photoners."""
st_061010_0770#0,"""But I love everyone in ARKS. And of course, you..."""
st_061010_0780#0,"""That's why I don't want to make the same mistake twice."""
