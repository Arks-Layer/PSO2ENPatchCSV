un_063060_0010#0,"""Great work, <%me>! I know we're out there all the time, but we've gotta stay strong."""
un_063060_0020#0,"""Welcome back, Master! You're working quite hard again... Just what one would expect from a Guardian!"""
un_063060_0025#0,"""I am glad to see you safe as well, Azanami... Is there anything wrong?"""
un_063060_0030#0,"""Hey Lucotte. Is it alright if I ask you something?"""
un_063060_0040#0,"""Of course!"""
un_063060_0050#0,"""You got something bothering you? Why not try getting it off your chest?"""
un_063060_0060#0,"""Huh? Wh-, Why... What makes you think..."""
un_063060_0070#0,"""You have trouble relying on others, yeah? You feel like you have to put on a cool front, and be the one people go to for help."""
un_063060_0080#0,"""G-Goodness... What gave you that impression...?"""
un_063060_0090#0,"""Why do you think? I'm actually the same way. So I can tell just by looking at you."""
un_063060_0100#0,"""You're convinced you're the one who gives out advice, not asks for it... Yeah?"""
un_063060_0110#0,"""Azanami..."""
un_063060_0120#0,"""Ah! No no, I'm not trying to call you out or anything! It's very noble to be someone people can rely on!"""
un_063060_0130#0,"""But you see... Everyone has each other's back here."""
un_063060_0140#0,"""Even you need people you can rely on, who will help you out."""
un_063060_0150#0,"""So there's absolutely nothing wrong with asking us for help with anything... Isn't that right, Guardian?"""
un_063060_0160#0,"""...Thank you very much. Your words have touched my heart... Very well, I shall impose on you just a bit."""
un_063060_0170#0,"""The truth is, I am not very confident that I can live up to everyone's expectations as the representative of a new class."""
un_063060_0180#0,"""Hmhm. Leading a new class is a big responsibility. I had it pretty rough too."""
un_063060_0190#0,"""Everyone expects you to be really strong, and to know exactly how to do everything."""
un_063060_0200#0,"""And that just makes things  harder. You can't ask anyone for help... Not even the other class reps."""
un_063060_0210#0,"""You have to put on a confident front while hiding your insecurities."""
un_063060_0220#0,"""But take it from me, it's totally natural to start without any confidence. You gain it as you gain experience."""
un_063060_0230#0,"""So you're doing fine, Lucotte! You have my personal guarantee... Be confident in your lack of confidence!"""
un_063060_0240#0,"""...Wait, was that a weird thing to say?"""
un_063060_0250#0,"""...Hehe. Not at all, it was wonderful."""
un_063060_0260#0,"""Ahahaa. I guess I didn't put it perfectly, but if it helped you relax at all, I'm glad I could do my part."""
un_063060_0270#0,"""Thank you... I am truly grateful to both of you. And, well..."""
un_063060_0280#0,"""If you have no objections, would it be alright to impose on you again...?"""
un_063060_0290#0,"""Ask us anytime!"""
un_063060_0300#0,"""Azanami will listen!"""
un_063060_0310#0,"""Master, Azanami... Thank you both very much."""
un_063060_0320#0,"""That's right! Just leave everything to me! ...Wait, what about you!"""
un_063060_0330#0,"""Hehe...! Thank you both very much."""
un_063060_0340#0,"""My experience still pales in comparison to yours. I will accept your offer, and rely on you two on occasion."""
un_063060_0350#0,"""I trust you will be of great help. Thank you for your kindness!"""
