st_064010_0010#0,"""Let's review our current situation."""
st_064010_0020#0,"""Thanks to Sukuna-hime's cooperation, we've eliminated one of the Photoners, Mitra. This is a huge success for us."""
st_064010_0030#0,"""Rest not upon thy laurels, youth. We were hoodwinked. Our true target remaineth yet unscathed."""
st_064010_0040#0,"""I'm not resting on anything. We've confirmed that it's possible to beat them if their powers are sealed."""
st_064010_0050#0,"""And it's probably for precisely that reason that Shiva's begun her all-out attack."""
st_064010_0060#0,"""We're able to predict where her attacks will hit in advance. So she's planning to overwhelm us before we can prepare ourselves."""
st_064010_0070#0,"""...Honestly, the situation is not favorable."""
st_064010_0080#0,"""We're holding out thanks to the improved A.I.S. we're deploying, but they won't stand a chance if Shiva herself attacks."""
st_064010_0090#0,"""The forces under Huey's command are currently buying us some time. But they can't keep it up forever..."""
st_064010_0100#0,"""...I would like to assist, but our attention is taken in full by the rampaging Magatsu, now that he be unsealed."""
st_064010_0110#0,"""To add further insult, we have had little choice but to rely on thee ARKS to assist in our campaign... We are a pitiable sight."""
st_064010_0120#0,"""Tama-hime..."""
st_064010_0130#0,"""Sukuna-hime. You should give top priority to recovering from your own wounds."""
st_064010_0140#0,"""...Understood. I will inform thee of any developments."""
st_064010_0150#0,"""I apologize for the wait. It's a pleasure to meet you, Phaleg."""
st_064010_0160#0,"""It is quite alright. I have experienced the dire situation the ARKS face firsthand."""
st_064010_0170#0,"""...You mean Shiva."""
st_064010_0180#0,"""Despite her preoccupation fighting you all, she was far from overwhelmed. That is why my attack did not hit its mark."""
st_064010_0190#0,"""She possesses incredible power and the clarity of mind to accurately analyze the situation, and fights making optimal use of those abilities."""
st_064010_0200#0,"""She cannot be stopped through normal means."""
st_064010_0210#0,"""Of course, that is what makes this fun."""
st_064010_0220#0,"""Umm... What made you decide to come here, Phaleg?"""
st_064010_0230#0,"""That is simple. One, I sensed the presence of a strong foe."""
st_064010_0240#0,"""And two, I have felt an unsettling atmosphere on Earth..."""

st_064010_0290#0,"""I know you guys aren't doing so great, but<br>we've got big trouble too! Monsters have appeared - and they aren't Phantoms!"""
st_064010_0300#0,"""Those are Photoner forces! Why are they on Earth...!"""
st_064010_0310#0,"""...They were sent by Shiva. Or rather, Shiva has finally revealed them. She wishes to crush all worlds at once."""
st_064010_0320#0,"""I shall return in advance. They alone will not be enough... Ophiel."""
st_064010_0330#0,"""We aren't in the best shape, but we can't just ignore them."""
