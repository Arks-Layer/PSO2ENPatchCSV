st_061120_0020#0,"""Hehehehehe. Because Lisa actually uses her eyes."""
st_061120_0030#0,"""Huh?"""
st_061120_0040#0,"""All the ARKS rely too much on Photons. More than they rely on their eyes."""
st_061120_0050#0,"""Even though you can't see, you rely on radar to decide where to attack, yes? It's true."""
st_061120_0060#0,"""Everyone thinks they are using their eyes, but they really sense Photons and their movements."""
st_061120_0070#0,"""But these enemies hide their Photons."""
st_061120_0080#0,"""And they can read our Photons instead.<br>Naturally, you can't keep up."""
st_061120_0090#0,"""In other words, there's nothing you can do about them."""
st_061120_0100#0,"""Then, we'll never be able to fight them<br>normally...?"""
st_061120_0110#0,"""If you discover some technology greater than the enemy's, you could fight just like normal."""

st_061120_0150#0,"""Young lady, are you alone?"""
st_061120_0160#0,"""You intend to face me alone, with such weak Photons? You underestimate me."""
