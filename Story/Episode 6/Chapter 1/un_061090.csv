un_061090_0010#0,"""Those Photoners were incredibly strong."""
un_061090_0020#0,"""Their ability to absorb Photons makes nearly all of our attacks completely useless."""
un_061090_0030#0,"""Do you think all Photoners are able to do that?"""
un_061090_0040#0,"""This is just speculation... But I believe it is because of Shiva's blessing."""
un_061090_0050#0,"""Her blessing...?"""
un_061090_0060#0,"""Yes, Shiva is the only Photoner capable of absorbing Photons."""
un_061090_0070#0,"""She was created for that express purpose, so it is an ability unique to her."""
un_061090_0080#0,"""Shiva has granted use of that same ability to her Photoner allies."""
un_061090_0090#0,"""And now all of them are capable of absorbing Photons?"""
un_061090_0100#0,"""Yes, precisely so. However, there are individual differences among those granted it, so it is not without fault."""
un_061090_0110#0,"""Huh? Really?"""
un_061090_0120#0,"""Yes. The amount of Photons absorbed cannot exceed the maximum quantity the host is capable of containing."""
un_061090_0130#0,"""In other words, if you are able to output more Photons than the enemy can absorb in an attack, they will be unable to absorb any more and take damage."""
un_061090_0140#0,"""The proof lies in the fact that you were able to defeat the Photoner forces."""
un_061090_0150#0,"""Ah, I see. We managed to beat them even with how strong they were."""
un_061090_0160#0,"""Which means, if we were somehow able to mount an attack that surpassed Shiva's Photon limits..."""
un_061090_0170#0,"""Yes, it would be possible."""
un_061090_0180#0,"""However... Shiva is [Profound Darkness] itself."""
un_061090_0190#0,"""A being created to absorb all Photons."""
un_061090_0200#0,"""We would need to discover a way to surpass such an unfathomable capacity..."""
un_061090_0210#0,"""That's... definitely quite the predicament."""
