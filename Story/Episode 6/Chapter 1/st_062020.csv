st_062020_0020#0,"""No need to ask, it's obvious. You've come for information on Shiva."""
st_062020_0030#0,"""Sorry to disappoint, but I don't know much about her at all."""
st_062020_0040#0,"""It's as Harriet told you."""
st_062020_0050#0,"""I created her. The ultimate vessel for Photons... Without a doubt, my masterpiece."""
st_062020_0060#0,"""A vessel with a self, with an ego. The very creation of intelligent life."""
st_062020_0070#0,"""The beginnings of Xion... Intelligence born spontaneously within the sea. I had finally replicated that phenomenon."""
st_062020_0080#0,"""If not for those barbarians who only saw her for a vessel... We could have reached true omniscience."""
st_062020_0090#0,"""We had the time. The technology. The Akashic Record as our guide."""
st_062020_0100#0,"""And yet, they desired an immediate solution."""
st_062020_0110#0,"""They tore the soul from its vessel, and filled it with Photons. Used it as a trap."""
st_062020_0120#0,"""A trap for [Profound Darkness], who exists only to erase Photons."""
st_062020_0130#0,"""They were successful. [Profound Darkness] entered the vessel, gained sentience, and bound itself to it."""
st_062020_0140#0,"""And then, it was simply discarded..."""
st_062020_0150#0,"""They had made a mistake... [Profound Darkness], now Shiva, had acquired intelligence. An understanding of humans."""
st_062020_0160#0,"""She left the Dark Falz... A cancer that fed off of humanity's greed. A wedge upon society through which she might someday return."""
st_062020_0170#0,"""...Wedges that found their way inside of us."""
st_062020_0180#0,"""Well? Quite the dreary story, wasn't it?"""
st_062020_0190#0,"""Yet I have told it to you... Think of it as an act of gratitude from me. From Luther."""
st_062020_0200#0,"""You rescued Harriet's soul... That knowledge alone is of great benefit to myself."""
st_062020_0210#0,"""...Xion must have been aware of her. It's no wonder she felt some sympathy."""
