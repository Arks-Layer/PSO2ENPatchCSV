un_061130_0030#0,"""You don't understand them?"""
un_061130_0040#0,"""That's right. They don't show any signs of life, so we know that they're autonomous machines."""
un_061130_0050#0,"""However, their structure and composition are nothing like any technology we ARKS possess."""
un_061130_0060#0,"""These mysterious mechanical weapons... ARKS has named them \""Luminmechs\""."""
un_061130_0070#0,"""Their mobility, armor, and destructive ability...every parameter is unbelievably high. If they can make weapons like that..."""
un_061130_0080#0,"""They are machines built using the technology of the Photoners."""
un_061130_0090#0,"""They're made with Photoner technology... And not even ARKS can make sense of them."""
un_061130_0100#0,"""Correct. The current technological capabilities of ARKS are no match for them."""
un_061130_0110#0,"""They are weapons created with their cutting edge technology in order to combat [Profound Darkness]..."""

un_061130_0150#0,"""We can still defeat them."""
un_061130_0160#0,"""They must have a weak point."""
