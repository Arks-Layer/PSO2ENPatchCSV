st_061140_0020#0,"""Why did we retreat?!"""
st_061140_0030#0,"""We have to avenge Xiao!"""
st_061140_0040#0,"""I knew you two were going to react like this."""
st_061140_0050#0,"""I had the choice between the Mothership...between Xiao, and you two... And I chose you."""
st_061140_0060#0,"""And I stand steadfast by that decision. Xiao would have done the same."""
st_061140_0070#0,"""Xiao's kin. Sara, was it? Are you able to see me now?"""
st_061140_0080#0,"""Who are...?"""
st_061140_0090#0,"""I am Alma. The first Claris Claes."""
st_061140_0100#0,"""I was around when you came here before, but you weren't able to see me."""
st_061140_0110#0,"""...But now, you can. Do you know why?"""
st_061140_0120#0,"""...Because of Xiao's power?"""
st_061140_0130#0,"""Yes. Xiao's power is now with you. Xiao is sleeping within you."""
st_061140_0140#0,"""His power is too much for you to contain. If he awakens, it would destroy you... So he's sleeping now."""
st_061140_0150#0,"""I see...Xiao is... He's inside of me."""
st_061140_0160#0,"""Get it together, everyone!"""
st_061140_0170#0,"""Xiera, why do you think Xiao has been spreading out his authority?"""
st_061140_0180#0,"""Matoi! <%me>! Everything would have been meaningless if you died there! You have to look at the big picture!"""
st_061140_0190#0,"""S-Sara?"""
st_061140_0200#0,"""...Is what Xiao would have said. Those feelings came bubbling out from inside me."""
st_061140_0210#0,"""And he'd definitely say this. \""It's not in my nature to stay dead.\"""""
st_061140_0220#0,"""...That does sound like him."""
st_061140_0230#0,"""...Xiao always hated losing."""
st_061140_0240#0,"""Xiera, can you get in contact with all the other ships? Do we know what ARKS' status is?"""
st_061140_0250#0,"""Ah, yes! All ships are currently under independent operation!"""
st_061140_0260#0,"""This is ARKS's current state. The ships are all scattered about, but we've confirmed the presence of all Council members."""
st_061140_0270#0,"""The Operators are verifying the headcount right now. We should have everything together within the hour."""
st_061140_0280#0,"""Xiao foresaw this outcome... That's why he's been delegating responsibility down the ranks, making sure ARKS would function without him."""
st_061140_0290#0,"""But that's too bad for you, Xiao. We're not letting you retire just yet."""
st_061140_0300#0,"""Xiera, change course! We're heading for Planet Amduscia!"""
st_061140_0310#0,"""Amduscia?"""
st_061140_0320#0,"""...It was the last thing Xiao said to me. \""Make for Amduscia.\"""""
st_061140_0330#0,"""I know we'll find the key there. The key to unlocking this stalemate."""
