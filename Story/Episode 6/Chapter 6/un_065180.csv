un_065180_0010#0,"""If you could tell me about it for future reference, I'd be thankful..."""
un_065180_0020#0,"""You say that, but honestly, I mean... Hold on, Ulc! Are you the one who put Io up to this?"""
un_065180_0030#0,"""Some reputation I have! Io's just curious about it, that's all. Curious about newly married life, that is!"""
un_065180_0040#0,"""So when you said you wanted to talk about the future, that was your real goal, huh..."""
un_065180_0050#0,"""Ah, <%me>!<br>Help me out here. Can you tell these two that this really isn't the time for this kind of thing?"""
un_065180_0060#0,"""This really isn't the time."""
un_065180_0070#0,"""Married life! Let's hear it!"""
un_065180_0080#0,"""Well aren't you amenable. I take it you think I'm an irresponsible commander slacking on her duties too? Why, I'd never."""
un_065180_0090#0,"""Oh, you little traitor. I don't need to hear it from you too, of all people!"""
un_065180_0100#0,"""First of all Echo, you've got the wrong idea. This is entirely for the sake of the future."""
un_065180_0110#0,"""W-What does m-my married life with Zeno have to do with the future... Shouldn't you be like, doing commander work or something?"""
un_065180_0120#0,"""As a matter of fact, I'm done with alllll of my work as commander! Now, we're just waiting for the final battle to kick off."""
un_065180_0130#0,"""It's a little late to be pulling our hair out now. So meanwhile, this is probably the best time to be thinking about this."""
un_065180_0140#0,"""The best time..."""
un_065180_0150#0,"""...to be thinking about this?"""
un_065180_0160#0,"""Yeah. Thinking about the future, I mean. About our plans for when all of this is over."""
un_065180_0170#0,"""This isn't a battle to defeat our enemies. It's a battle to fight for a peaceful future."""
un_065180_0180#0,"""We have to remember what we're fighting for, so we should think about our plans for when we achieve it. Don't you think that's important?"""
un_065180_0190#0,"""That's... true. I guess I'm a little too used to thinking about defeating Darkers."""
un_065180_0200#0,"""Now that you mention it, yeah. We're fighting for a peaceful future."""
un_065180_0210#0,"""Darn right! So let's hear about the bright married future you're gonna fight for and win, Echo!"""
un_065180_0220#0,"""Please, Echo! I don't know anything about that stuff, so I don't even know what a future like it would be like."""
un_065180_0230#0,"""...Hahh, alright, fine. Just don't expect too much of me. So, what is it you wanted to know?"""
un_065180_0240#0,"""I-I'll ask first, okay? It's something that's been on my mind, er, that is to say, um, wh-when..."""
un_065180_0250#0,"""When, uh, when someone you like also likes you back, what sort of feeling is it?!"""
un_065180_0260#0,"""Oof, so innocent... Uhm, well it's called reciprocated love, and, well... How can I put it? It's hard to express with words."""
un_065180_0270#0,"""It's like being so relieved that you could wrap yourself up in it. Like you can really put your trust in them."""
un_065180_0280#0,"""You know, until we got engaged, I was really nervous all the time. When Zeno disappeared, I knew he would come back, but I still worried."""
un_065180_0290#0,"""But after we got married, I could finally fully trust Zeno. It's like all my worries vanished overnight."""
un_065180_0300#0,"""Io, pay close attention. This is what's known as bragging about your spouse."""
un_065180_0310#0,"""Hey, you're the one who asked!! How awful is that, <%me>ï¼Ÿ"""
un_065180_0320#0,"""D'aww, that was sweeter than a parfait!"""
un_065180_0330#0,"""Yeah, definitely bragging."""
un_065180_0340#0,"""I'm just telling you because you asked! Gosh, I shouldn't have said anything!"""
un_065180_0350#0,"""Really?! I didn't mean to sound like that. Uh, my bad."""
un_065180_0360#0,"""Anyways, before the fighting starts, I'm gonna go visit Theo or something. Seeya!"""
un_065180_0370#0,"""Yeah... I kind of want to hear Zeno's voice now. See you around, you two!"""
un_065180_0380#0,"""Ahhhh...<br>U-U-Uhm, hey... <%me>."""
un_065180_0390#0,"""If you've got some time... Just for a bit, do you want to... go get some tea with me?"""
