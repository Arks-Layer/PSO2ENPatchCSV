un_061140_0020#0,"""...I see, so it's like this. Live data really is a whole different beast."""
un_061140_0030#0,"""The drive system's load is crazy. While it boosted its mobility, the reduced durability is a tough pill to swallow..."""
un_061140_0040#0,"""Ahaha... Doesn't seeing her so absorbed in her work like this kind of remind you of Xiera a bit?"""
un_061140_0050#0,"""Now that you mention it..."""
un_061140_0060#0,"""They don't look similar at all."""
un_061140_0070#0,"""See what I mean? Almost like they're long lost siblings..."""
un_061140_0080#0,"""I'm not talking about their appearance. I meant that they look similar when they're focused on their work."""
un_061140_0090#0,"""But it must just be my imagination. Xiera's the only High Cast on the ships."""
un_061140_0100#0,"""I guess that would make us similar. Either way, I am a High Cast. Ludmilla type."""

un_061140_0150#0,"""And that's how I was made. I'm the Research Division's A.I.S. Specialized High Cast, Ludmilla."""
un_061140_0160#0,"""I see! So there are other High Casts besides<br>Xiera."""
un_061140_0170#0,"""Yup. And it's my sworn duty to thoroughly research, improve, and exceed in the field of A.I.S."""
un_061140_0180#0,"""Which means I need all the data on them I can get for my work."""
un_061140_0190#0,"""So get me everything you can. Toodles."""
un_061140_0200#0,"""Hearing all of that really makes me want to help, even though I'm not any good at piloting them."""
