un_064110_0010#0,"""Ah, <%me>. Got a sec?"""
un_064110_0020#0,"""Let's see... Do you know Lisa?"""
un_064110_0030#0,"""I do."""
un_064110_0040#0,"""I don't."""
un_064110_0050#0,"""Of course, you're a real celeb. Can I ask you for a quick favor?"""
un_064110_0060#0,"""Really? You're pretty famous, so I was sure you would have known her somehow. Well, I'll ask anyway."""
un_064110_0070#0,"""I was looking over the operational data I got from Lisa's A.I.S., but I noticed some abnormalities in the firing reaction speed."""
un_064110_0080#0,"""She was able to perceive the enemy's position faster than her radar was. It's just completely unbelievable."""
un_064110_0090#0,"""If I could figure out the reason why, I could power up the A.I.S. even further, so I wanted to pick her brain..."""
un_064110_0100#0,"""What about Lisa?"""
un_064110_0110#0,"""Whoa, didn't expect that! So you are Lisa?"""
un_064110_0120#0,"""Yes yes, Lisa is here. Do you have business with Lisa?"""
un_064110_0130#0,"""Yes. I've been looking at the data from the A.I.S. you were piloting, and I had some questions..."""
un_064110_0140#0,"""There were numerous entries in the logs where you hit your mark before your radar even registered them, and I was wondering how you did it."""
un_064110_0150#0,"""That question is easy, Lisa was just shooting at what her eyes saw."""
un_064110_0160#0,"""Huh...? You saw them with your eyes?"""
un_064110_0170#0,"""Lisa does not rely on radar while fighting. Even during A.I.S. combat."""
un_064110_0180#0,"""When Lisa's eyes find a target, she shoots."""
un_064110_0190#0,"""It's your eyesight...?!"""
un_064110_0200#0,"""Wait, so... Your eyes find your target and you shoot... I see..."""
un_064110_0210#0,"""If we increase camera drive speed and analysis power instead of Photon reaction times, it should achieve the same effect..."""
un_064110_0220#0,"""Though to be honest, Lisa doesn't really like using the A.I.S. She can't feel the enemies being shot."""
un_064110_0230#0,"""Yeah, if we can get the XHD image analysis down below 16 milliseconds, then we can redirect the radar map..."""
un_064110_0240#0,"""There's no better feeling than shooting and shooting and shooting an enemy full of holes with your own hands."""
un_064110_0250#0,"""And then if we combine that with the Photon sensors, we should be able to boost radar speed by over 22%... Thanks a million, Lisa!"""
un_064110_0260#0,"""My my my goodness. What a strange woman."""
un_064110_0270#0,"""Ah right right, why did you tell her you didn't know Lisa earlier?"""
