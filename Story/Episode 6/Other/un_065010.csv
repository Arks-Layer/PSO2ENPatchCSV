un_065010_0010#0,"""Well well. Fancy meeting you here."""
un_065010_0020#0,"""Lisa was just introducing her to Zieg."""
un_065010_0030#0,"""A Rifle-class Genesis Weapon, Star Gun Harriet... I see, I see."""
un_065010_0040#0,"""And where exactly is Harriet?"""
un_065010_0050#0,"""I am in here."""
un_065010_0060#0,"""Ohh, your Photons were used to give power to the Genesis Weapon. A special one, just like Aurora."""
un_065010_0070#0,"""The other Genesis Weapons don't have personalities?"""
un_065010_0080#0,"""The other ones aren't like this?"""
un_065010_0090#0,"""Right, they don't."""
un_065010_0100#0,"""Right, the other Genesis Weapons don't talk like that."""
un_065010_0110#0,"""They're picky about their wielders, but they never speak directly using words."""
un_065010_0120#0,"""Weapons like Tsukuriyo and Clarissa III were not created using anyone as a basis."""
un_065010_0130#0,"""However, Aurora and Harriet are completely different. Those two have wills of their own."""
un_065010_0140#0,"""My guess is their souls were linked to these forms through Photons. Then they would link with the user and manifest their power."""
un_065010_0150#0,"""The older Genesis Weapons possessed human souls too. Because of their connection to Xion, they can produce overwhelming results."""
un_065010_0160#0,"""Unfortunately, that means the weapon's lifespan depends on how long the soul remains."""
un_065010_0170#0,"""That's how it was with Yonohate. I could repair its physical form, but its power never returned... The soul that was contained was lost."""
un_065010_0180#0,"""...It is likely that Yonohate's soul felt that it had completed its duties. Having accomplished its mission, it disappeared satisfied."""
un_065010_0190#0,"""I'm sure it found its peace."""
un_065010_0200#0,"""...Guess so."""
un_065010_0210#0,"""With that said, I feel bad for Labrys after all the times I've had to repair it."""
un_065010_0220#0,"""I wonder if it wants to be replaced too. If only I could ask the soul how it feels."""
