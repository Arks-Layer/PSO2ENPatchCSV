un_061180_0010#0,"""Yo, partner. Feels like it's been ages since it's been just the two of us."""
un_061180_0020#0,"""I've heard about everything going on. We were so close to making a breakthrough, but it wasn't enough just yet."""
un_061180_0030#0,"""I'm sure I told you before, but Lida and I are part of General Affairs. Between work and fighting, we've got our hands full."""
un_061180_0040#0,"""Of course, it's probably way less hectic than what they put you through."""
un_061180_0050#0,"""But still, if there's anything I can do, no matter how small is, I'll do it. Anything to help out my partner!"""
un_061180_0060#0,"""Your support's been keeping me going."""
un_061180_0070#0,"""Is that what you really want?"""
un_061180_0080#0,"""...That's a real honor, coming from you. But in the end... it's kinda for something I want to do."""
un_061180_0090#0,"""Haha... nothing gets by you, huh? But I am serious about wanting to help you."""
un_061180_0100#0,"""But yeah. I want to make it so Lida and Aurora are able to live freely..."""
un_061180_0110#0,"""After all... It's gotta be rough living with the burden of being a Dark Falz, right?"""
un_061180_0120#0,"""That's the next goal I set for myself. Seems like you guessed it."""
un_061180_0130#0,"""And my goal after that is to stand by your side and do everything I can to..."""
un_061180_0140#0,"""Ah...! I forgot I promised I'd meet up with Lida.<br>I've gotta go!"""
un_061180_0150#0,"""Sorry, partner. See you some other time. Let's keep at it!"""
