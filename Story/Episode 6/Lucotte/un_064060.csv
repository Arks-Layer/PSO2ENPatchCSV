un_064060_0010#0,"""It's good to see you, Master! \""Silver Lining\"" Lucotte, at your service."""
un_064060_0020#0,"""Wh-, \""Silver Lining\""...? What's that about?!"""
un_064060_0030#0,"""Hehe... I was mimicking Kyo's nickname. How was it, Master?"""
un_064060_0040#0,"""It's a fine nickname."""
un_064060_0050#0,"""It's, uh..."""
un_064060_0060#0,"""I'm honored to have earned your praise! How elating!"""
un_064060_0070#0,"""Oh, did you not like it? That is too bad..."""
un_064060_0080#0,"""It requires great courage to introduce yourself using a nickname... Kyo possesses an incredible amount!"""
un_064060_0090#0,"""Yeah. When we were little Kyo started using them out of nowhere!"""
un_064060_0100#0,"""\""From now on I am the 'Prime Meteor'!\"""""
un_064060_0110#0,"""It took me by total surprise. Though I never did call him that!"""
un_064060_0120#0,"""How nostalgic. That must have been right before I contracted acute Photonosis."""
un_064060_0130#0,"""That's right! Speaking of surprises, I never expected you to become a Cast, Luco."""
un_064060_0140#0,"""You were gone from school for a long time, but then you came back as a Cast out of nowhere! You were so much taller, and you graduated right away!"""
un_064060_0150#0,"""That is right. Normally, the Cast conversion process occurs shortly after birth when the condition is discovered. So a late onset of Photonosis is quite rare..."""
un_064060_0160#0,"""Despite the unusualness of my situation it was deemed necessary, and I underwent the process during my school years."""
un_064060_0170#0,"""As a result, I was given this body while still a student..."""
un_064060_0180#0,"""At first I was worried that you both would be frightened of me or hate me for it..."""
un_064060_0190#0,"""There's no way we'd hate you! You were our dear Luco, and nothing was going to change that!"""
un_064060_0200#0,"""Hehe. You have always said that, haven't you Stratos."""
un_064060_0210#0,"""But back then... I had lost my original heart after becoming a Cast..."""
un_064060_0220#0,"""My love for hospitality... Even when I froze because I couldn't suppress my feelings in battle..."""
un_064060_0230#0,"""The two of you gave me the strength to be myself, and I was able to move again."""
un_064060_0240#0,"""I still cherish the flower accessory you gave me dearly, and have kept it with me always."""
un_064060_0250#0,"""That takes me back. I made it as a get well charm for you."""
un_064060_0260#0,"""Hm...? Didn't Kyo give you some kind of gift back then too...?"""
un_064060_0270#0,"""Yes! That is when Kyo gave me my nickname."""
un_064060_0280#0,"""Ohh, now I remember! You were completely dumbfounded when he announced it."""
un_064060_0290#0,"""His nickname for me then was \""Wandering White Cloud\""."""
un_064060_0300#0,"""Right, Kyo got so upset because he couldn't think up a good name! Oh, so is \""Silver Lining\""...?"""
un_064060_0310#0,"""Hehe... It was a collaborative effort between us."""
un_064060_0320#0,"""Aw man, now I kinda want a nickname too... That way we'd all be..."""
un_064060_0330#0,"""Then I shall grant you one... From this point on you will be Stratos, the \""Azure Streak\""... Carry it well."""
un_064060_0340#0,"""\""Azure Streak\""...! That's great, Kyo!"""
un_064060_0350#0,"""It is! It has a gallant tone that fits you perfectly Stratos!"""
un_064060_0360#0,"""Alright, let's give it a go then..."""
un_064060_0370#0,"""Stratos the \""Azure Streak\""!"""
un_064060_0380#0,"""Lucotte the \""Silver Lining\""!"""
un_064060_0390#0,"""Th-This is...way too embarrassing! I can't do it!"""
un_064060_0400#0,"""Really...? That is unfortunate, it seemed quite cool to me..."""
