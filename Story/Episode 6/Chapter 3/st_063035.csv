st_063030_0030#0,"""Alma! Are you feeling better now?"""
st_063030_0040#0,"""Better, but not my best. Xiao's back up and running, so I can't just sleep all day."""
st_063030_0050#0,"""Here are our predictions for the enemy's movements. The omens indicate they'll be in the city, seems they're planning on boarding us directly again."""
st_063030_0060#0,"""The Photons feel like they're just scouts. If they really wanted to fight, it would feel more like beebeebeep."""
st_063030_0070#0,"""Still, as long as we know they're coming, we can prepare countermeasures!"""
st_063030_0080#0,"""They can probably predict our movements as<br>well, but if we intercept them right as they appear, it should catch them off-guard momentarily."""
st_063030_0090#0,"""In short, the first blow is critical. I want our spearhead to be you two."""
st_063030_0100#0,"""Leave it to us."""
st_063030_0110#0,"""I'm a little uneasy."""
st_063030_0120#0,"""Yeah. I'll do my best too!"""
st_063030_0130#0,"""...Don't worry, <%me>. I'll be right there by your side!"""
st_063030_0140#0,"""Alright, I'm counting on you both."""
