st_063060_0010#0,"""...Even our enhanced model A.I.S. were nothing more than toys to her. It's just too much."""
st_063060_0020#0,"""Her Photon retention capabilities are beyond imagination, so Photon-based attacks won't work."""
st_063060_0030#0,"""And she uses what she absorbs to strengthen her body enough to deflect physical attacks. Goodness gracious... She's a real monster."""
st_063060_0040#0,"""...Hypothetical calculations, complete."""
st_063060_0050#0,"""Our estimates were completely off. Here's the theoretical upper limit of Shiva's strength, based on what we've witnessed."""
st_063060_0060#0,"""Ho-... Th-... What is this?! You must have made some kind of mistake!"""
st_063060_0070#0,"""...It's equivalent to the sum of all ARKS members. There's no way that could be!"""
st_063060_0080#0,"""And yet, it is."""
st_063060_0090#0,"""If you remember that she's one single person containing the entire strength of the Photoners, it makes sense."""
st_063060_0100#0,"""When she appeared on the ARKS ship previously, she really was just playing around."""
st_063060_0110#0,"""But, <%me> and I couldn't touch her even back then..."""
st_063060_0120#0,"""Without some serious Photons behind our attacks, she's just going to absorb or deflect everything..."""
st_063060_0130#0,"""We'd need power on her level if we wanted a fair fight."""
st_063060_0140#0,"""We'll need to match her somehow..."""
st_063060_0150#0,"""If we had some way to seal away her strength..."""
st_063060_0160#0,"""...You're not wrong. You or Matoi would likely be able to reach her level, given enough time."""
st_063060_0170#0,"""But that's not a realistic option. If we can't raise ourselves up to her abilities, we have to find some way to bring her down to ours."""
st_063060_0180#0,"""That's right. That's our best option for tackling this."""
st_063060_0190#0,"""A way to seal off Photons..."""
st_063060_0200#0,"""...Ah. Just like that one time."""
st_063060_0210#0,"""Right. When Matoi became [Profound Darkness], we sealed that power with Sukuna-hime's Braided Ash Formation."""
st_063060_0220#0,"""It was a barrier created to contain Magatsu's power."""
st_063060_0230#0,"""If we could use it on Shiva... If we could seal off her Photons with it, we'd have a chance."""
