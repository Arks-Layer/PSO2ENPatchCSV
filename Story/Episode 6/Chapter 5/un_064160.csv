un_064160_0020#0,"""Huh? That's where I live. It was built for me, so it is only natural I use it."""
un_064160_0030#0,"""I see... Then, you're only visiting Cuent Castle here."""
un_064160_0040#0,"""Wrong, this castle belongs to me as well."""
un_064160_0050#0,"""...What?"""
un_064160_0060#0,"""After all, I am none other than the Divine Queen of the Divine Magic Kingdom of Epicuent!"""
un_064160_0070#0,"""It is only proper that I own both a castle and a royal palace!"""
un_064160_0080#0,"""Marge, you've only gotten more arrogant since merging with Cuent. It's actually impressive!"""
un_064160_0090#0,"""Quiet, you! It's fine, this is my country so obviously it's my castle too!"""
un_064160_0100#0,"""How do you get back and forth? They're quite a long distance from each other."""

un_064160_0140#0,"""...I suppose if Alisa is fine with it."""
un_064160_0150#0,"""Even though they have merged, the cultures and environments of Cuent and Epic are too dissimilar."""
un_064160_0160#0,"""Forcing integration too quickly would cause discord among the citizenry."""
un_064160_0170#0,"""So I decided that traveling between the two countries and listening to all of my people would be the best way to go about ruling."""
un_064160_0180#0,"""The sword maiden understands that and agreed to help."""
un_064160_0190#0,"""Is that so..."""
un_064160_0200#0,"""Hmhmmm, have you moved past your blasphemy and recognized my greatness? You may praise and worship me."""
un_064160_0210#0,"""Marge... You're a real royal piece of work!"""
