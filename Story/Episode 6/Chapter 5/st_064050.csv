st_064050_0020#0,"""Don't give me that! It was a standard medical procedure!"""
st_064050_0030#0,"""I can't believe you keep running around with injuries like that!"""

st_064050_0070#0,"""I know it was an emergency situation! But you're allowed to complain!"""
st_064050_0080#0,"""Got that, Guardian? Come to the Medical Center if you're injured! Alright?"""
st_064050_0090#0,"""Oh my my goodness, that was a serious scolding."""
st_064050_0100#0,"""Matoi would be better off taking a break, yes?"""
st_064050_0110#0,"""Oh, Lisa. You've returned."""
