st_064110_0020#0,"""...Well met. However, my purpose is still fulfilled."""
st_064110_0030#0,"""What are-...!"""
st_064110_0040#0,"""The opposite of your goal...! Using my body, I shall destroy the spirit vein..."""
st_064110_0050#0,"""And through the Mana excited by battle, shatter the gathered energy!"""
st_064110_0060#0,"""...Haa. That was the most unpleasant target Lisa has shot to date. Don't you agree, Harriet?"""
st_064110_0070#0,"""...Well done, Lady Harriet."""
st_064110_0080#0,"""Varuna... Why go this far? Is Shiva really someone for whom you would risk your own life?"""
st_064110_0090#0,"""I do not understand it myself. However, I know that my liege will shed no tears even if I am to perish here."""
st_064110_0100#0,"""...You want to know why, even then?"""
st_064110_0110#0,"""My loyalty was kept with no expectation of any reward. Nor was it involuntary."""
st_064110_0120#0,"""Even falling in battle for my liege was, without any doubt, done of my own volition."""
st_064110_0130#0,"""However, Lady Harriet..."""
st_064110_0140#0,"""I... The time I spent here was not as the God of Fidelity... I walked alongside you as myself."""
st_064110_0150#0,"""Our time together was short, but... I am thankful."""
st_064110_0160#0,"""...Varuna."""
st_064110_0170#0,"""Guardian... I know not what is right, or what is wrong."""
st_064110_0180#0,"""The outcome of your battle with my liege will be decided by the world."""
st_064110_0190#0,"""I leave the rest... to you."""
st_064110_0200#0,"""Varuna... May you find peace..."""
st_064110_0210#0,"""Harriet..."""
st_064110_0220#0,"""...I am alright, Margareta. There is no time to mourn. The fighting continues even now."""
st_064110_0230#0,"""If we do not take control of the spirit vein and erect the barrier, neither Omega nor Oracle will know peace... I shall become the link here."""
st_064110_0240#0,"""Enemy activity has ceased! We've sealed the Photoners' power...!"""
st_064110_0250#0,"""However, I am not Sukuna-hime, so the barrier is not perfect. As such its effects will not be absolute."""
st_064110_0260#0,"""I shall remain here in order to maintain the barrier."""
st_064110_0270#0,"""I do not know how long I will be able to keep it active. Therefore... you must take care of the rest, Guardian."""
st_064110_0272#0,"""In that case, I shall remain here as well. Harriet is the deity of our land, and I am its Divine Queen!"""
st_064110_0274#0,"""Thank you, Margareta."""
st_064110_0280#0,"""...Lisa, I am grateful for all our time spent together. It was truly comforting."""
st_064110_0290#0,"""Oh my my my, should you really be making this sound like a final farewell?"""
st_064110_0300#0,"""Hmm? Your life is technically over already, so maybe that isn't wrong after all."""
st_064110_0310#0,"""But that isn't important. Lisa doesn't intend to make this a farewell at all in any way."""
st_064110_0320#0,"""There are still many fun things left to enjoy. So Lisa will see you again when this is all over."""
st_064110_0330#0,"""...I'm sure you will."""
