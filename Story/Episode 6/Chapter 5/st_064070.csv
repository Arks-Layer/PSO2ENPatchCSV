st_064070_0010#0,"""Confirmed arrival on Omega. We're in the southern plains of Cuent."""
st_064070_0020#0,"""...But, why's there a battle going on right here?!"""
st_064070_0030#0,"""Wow wow wow wow wow, how very fun it looks looks. Which side should Lisa shoot first?"""
st_064070_0040#0,"""...Wait, look closely! Those are...!"""
st_064070_0050#0,"""Photoner weapons?!"""
st_064070_0060#0,"""Why are they here?!"""
st_064070_0070#0,"""Oh my my, so the enemies were the first ones to arrive here?"""
st_064070_0080#0,"""We should speak with Margareta first. Everyone, to me!"""
st_064070_0090#0,"""Transient wings, come forth! Exit!"""
st_064070_0100#0,"""Nothing is working! Nothing is working!"""
st_064070_0110#0,"""Ooogh we're too shorthanded! I'd even accept help from a fairy at this point!"""
st_064070_0120#0,"""Won't someone please come help!"""
st_064070_0130#0,"""Wh-, Something's here?!"""
st_064070_0140#0,"""Margareta!"""
st_064070_0150#0,"""Harriet?! You've finally returned!"""
st_064070_0160#0,"""With the Guardian and fairy?! And this frightening thing... This smells of a rotten situation."""
st_064070_0170#0,"""A swift explanation will suffice. But first tell us of your situation. Where have those enemies come from?"""
st_064070_0180#0,"""...The lake where that black cocoon was. It was wise of us to leave the fortresses used during the battle with Elmir."""
st_064070_0190#0,"""Ah, we have already evacuated the citizens in the area. There is nothing to worry about on that end."""
st_064070_0200#0,"""Next, allow me to ask you a question... What are those things? Do you have some relation with them?"""
st_064070_0210#0,"""...I see, so some wicked superbeing from the Guardian's world has been causing all of these troubles."""
st_064070_0220#0,"""And now we have been dragged into it? Hurry and defeat them at once."""
st_064070_0230#0,"""We would if we were able to."""
st_064070_0240#0,"""But we never expected the Photoners to appear in this world as well."""
st_064070_0250#0,"""No no no no, isn't it obvious? This is essentially the contents of the Akashic Record."""
st_064070_0260#0,"""So why wouldn't something happening in Lisa's world also happen here?"""
st_064070_0270#0,"""Time is synchronized with Oracle's side, so the effects occur in real time..."""
st_064070_0280#0,"""Oracle's history has already been recorded, and the effects are being reproduced in Omega."""
st_064070_0290#0,"""This business sounds quite complicated, but are you saying that our problems will not vanish until yours are solved?"""
st_064070_0300#0,"""That's condensing things quite a bit, but in essence, yes."""
st_064070_0310#0,"""We were dragged into this mess, but our lots are now cast together. So, what should we do?"""
st_064070_0320#0,"""Harriet is making preparations for that right now."""
st_064070_0330#0,"""...I have returned."""
st_064070_0340#0,"""Welcome back, Harriet. Did it go well?"""
st_064070_0350#0,"""Of the six spirit veins that support this world, I have gained control of five of them."""
st_064070_0360#0,"""However, I am unable to reach the remaining one with my powers... It seems we have no choice but to seize it through direct means."""
st_064070_0370#0,"""...I'm getting a bad feeling about this."""
st_064070_0380#0,"""...What a coincidence, fairy. I'm getting that very same feeling."""
st_064070_0390#0,"""Could that place be...?"""
st_064070_0400#0,"""Is it the location of the black cocoon...?"""
st_064070_0410#0,"""...Yes. As you surmised, it is the location our enemies have gathered. The very spot that the black cocoon once stood."""
st_064070_0420#0,"""It was once used for healing purposes due to its location at the center of the spirit veins. But Elmir abused it in his desire for power."""
st_064070_0430#0,"""Now the entire region lies outside the influence of my divine powers."""
st_064070_0440#0,"""In other words, we'll need to part the sea of enemies ourselves to reach the center."""
st_064070_0450#0,"""...We did that not too long ago."""
st_064070_0460#0,"""Hehehehe. We're headed straight to the spot with lots of enemies."""
st_064070_0470#0,"""So so Lisa will get to shoot shoot shoot all all all of them?"""
st_064070_0480#0,"""Ah, how exciting! So exciting! Lisa gets to enjoy a front row seat on the frontlines."""
st_064070_0490#0,"""...Fairy, is that thing okay? It's giving me a nasty feeling... We're not going to get shot, are we?"""
st_064070_0500#0,"""Uhh..."""
st_064070_0510#0,"""Do not avert your gaze! It does not inspire confidence!"""
st_064070_0520#0,"""Don't worry about a thing. Three or fewer misfired shots doesn't count as friendly fire."""
st_064070_0530#0,"""If you're doing it on purpose, all your shots are friendly fire!"""
st_064070_0540#0,"""This is way more worrying than last time! If only the sword maiden wasn't off in Verun right now...!"""
st_064070_0550#0,"""Ohhh fine, there's no time for uncertainty! If we have to get this done then let us get it done! We move! Hurry, hurry!"""
