st_064100_0020#0,"""...Lady Harriet. I have been waiting."""
st_064100_0030#0,"""Huh-, wha? Huh? Are you not Harriet's adjutant? What are you doing here?"""
st_064100_0040#0,"""You are mistaken, Margareta. This Varuna... is our enemy."""
st_064100_0050#0,"""Hah?! Our enemy?! He swore his loyalty to you to the end!"""
st_064100_0060#0,"""The actions I took were necessary to further our great cause. Nothing more."""
st_064100_0070#0,"""For your great cause...? You staked your life in order to save Harriet!"""
st_064100_0080#0,"""Do you mean to tell me all of that was one great big farce?!"""
st_064100_0090#0,"""...Lady Margareta. The time for dialogue has passed."""
st_064100_0100#0,"""My liege is the Goddess of Demise, Shiva. My loyalty lies only with her. Any who stand in her way will be eliminated."""

st_064100_0150#0,"""I held no deep ties with you, but I am certain you never made such an expression. You had a much kinder look to you."""
st_064100_0160#0,"""Varuna..."""
st_064100_0170#0,"""To support my liege... Shiva, the ultimate existence. Mitra and I were created for that purpose, to obey any orders she gave us."""
st_064100_0180#0,"""But we were banished from the world, unable to complete our mission..."""
st_064100_0190#0,"""Even while sealed within the void... We were together."""
