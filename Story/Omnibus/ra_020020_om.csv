ra_020020_0010#0,"""Looks like you came."""
ra_020020_0020#0,"""<%me>, sorry for surprising you."""
ra_020020_0030#0,"""Lately you've just been looking so caught up in thought, I've been wondering..."""
ra_020020_0040#0,"""...who is that?"""
ra_020020_0050#0,"""1. You can see her?"""
ra_020020_0060#0,"""2. There's no one there."""
ra_020020_0070#0,"""Yes, is it someone I'm not supposed to see?"""
ra_020020_0080#0,"""But, there's someone wearing white right there."""
ra_020020_0090#0,"""The fact that she can see me is not a problem. She's different from Luther."""
ra_020020_0100#0,"""Like you, she's someone who has a relation to me. It's only natural she can see me."""
ra_020020_0110#0,"""I don't know why. I don't think I've met you and yet I feel very nostalgic somehow."""
ra_020020_0120#0,"""You don't need to think about it now. In time, it will come back to you."""
ra_020020_0130#0,"""I'm not sure exactly what you mean, but I trust your opinion."""
ra_020020_0140#0,"""I wonder if you're trusting me again, or is it that you still trust me?"""
ra_020020_0150#0,"""I trust you because <%me> trusts you."""
ra_020020_0160#0,"""I must thank you. Because you saved her at that time and that place, this has come to pass."""
ra_020020_0170#0,"""Because of that action, with sometime it will become a key to the future."""
ra_020020_0180#0,"""But more than importantly than that..."""
ra_020020_0190#0,"""Thank you for saving her. You have my gratitude."""
ra_020020_0200#0,"""It's like she's there and yet she's not there. It's hard to understand."""
ra_020020_0210#0,"""But she seems very warm. Almost like the same feeling when I first met you."""
ra_020020_0220#0,"""It seems you're involved in something very difficult, and this might add to that."""
ra_020020_0230#0,"""But please don't forget that I trust you and I'm always here for you."""
