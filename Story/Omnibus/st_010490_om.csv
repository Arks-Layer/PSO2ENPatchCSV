st_010490_0010#0,"""Hey, partner, what's that? Some sort of pattern? Maybe letters...?"""
st_010490_0020#0,"""Hmmmm, there seems to be a kind of logic to it... but I can't make heads or tails of it."""
st_010490_0030#0,"""That Lillipan just now... was he reading it? Maybe we can ask him about..."""
st_010490_0040#0,"""Oh... he's gone already. If the Lillipans can read this, then maybe we can get them to translate it for us?"""
st_010490_0050#0,"""But we still can't understand their language. So we couldn't even ask..."""
st_010490_0060#0,"""Well, there's nothing we can do now but look elsewhere, right, partner?"""
st_010490_0070#0,"""Is that you, <%me>? And... Afin, was it?"""
st_010490_0080#0,"""What a coincidence meeting you here. Anything I can help you guys with?"""
st_010490_0090#0,"""Oh, ummmm... you're Fourier, right?"""
st_010490_0100#0,"""That's right. I didn't really expect to run into anyone around here."""
st_010490_0110#0,"""Those markings... they look kind of like the symbols the Lillipans write."""
st_010490_0120#0,"""Really? These guys can read it?"""
st_010490_0130#0,"""He's saying, \""this way.\"" I wonder if there's something over there..."""
st_010490_0140#0,"""Ah, wait! I'm coming! Wait up!"""
st_010490_0150#0,"""They ran off. I guess she really has it rough..."""
st_010490_0160#0,"""Anyway, what next, partner? Go straight? I'm not sure we can make it..."""
st_010490_0170#0,"""Woah! What did you just do?"""
st_010490_0180#0,"""I blasted it!"""
st_010490_0190#0,"""Well, yeah. I can tell that much just by looking at it!"""
st_010490_0200#0,"""Now why'd you have to go and do that?"""
st_010490_0210#0,"""Because we couldn't get through. But look! Now we can!"""
st_010490_0220#0,"""Ah! He ran off. Wait up!"""
st_010490_0230#0,"""Well she sure is... energetic. You go first, partner. I'm tired...."""
