st_020070_0010#0,"""It's been a long time since I've paired with anyone like this. It really is fun."""
st_020070_0020#0,"""Before I was always with a higher up who always just told me what to do."""
st_020070_0030#0,"""But now they realize I can go out and get things done by myself, so they don't bother me any more."""
st_020070_0040#0,"""That's just an excuse though. I'm so much better than them that I leave them behind. They really don't know their place."""
st_020070_0050#0,"""Destroying every last Darker is what we do as ARKS, right? This is what you taught me."""
st_020070_0060#0,"""Are you worried about me?"""
st_020070_0070#0,"""No need for that. I'll just kill every last one of them, that's all there is to it. I won't die until I've finished that."""

st_020070_0130#0,"""...What are you waiting for? I still sense more of them. We need to hurry and kill more."""
