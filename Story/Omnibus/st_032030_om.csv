st_032030_0020#0,"""...Luther's death seems to have been the trigger for unlocking these facilities. The timing matches perfectly."""
st_032030_0030#0,"""In addition, there's a lot of information. This could have been used as the main terminal for the facilities at the seabed."""
st_032030_0040#0,"""Included in that data... seems to be information on creature experimentation."""
st_032030_0050#0,"""The experiments conducted on local Wopal natives include organic remodeling, synthesis, and experiments to implant intelligence artificially..."""
st_032030_0060#0,"""By any chance, does the intelligence implantation experiment refer to us?"""
st_032030_0070#0,"""Judging from the data, that seems to be the correct conclusion... I'm sorry."""
st_032030_0080#0,"""Why are you apologizing, girlie? You neither came up with the experiment nor did it yourself."""
st_032030_0090#0,"""I'm not really looking for an apology, and haven't thought of asking for one either. I can talk, and that's pretty convenient, ya know?"""
st_032030_0100#0,"""Don't apologize without a reason, girlie. That kinda hurts, seeing you sympathize without knowing."""

st_032030_0120#0,"""Did ya fall for me? I already have Camarotz, someone I treasure."""
st_032030_0130#0,"""Enough with the stupid jokes for<br>now. ...Hmmm, this info. The protection on it is very heavy."""

st_032030_0190#0,"""You're shocked, aren't you?<br>Finding out that you are a clone."""
st_032030_0200#0,"""I saw the evidence myself after all. But I've already gotten over it."""
st_032030_0210#0,"""I've been confused, I've cried too. Even now, I would be lying if I said<br>I'm fine, but I can still bear it."""
