st_010520_0010#0,"""Hey, <%me>. I figured you'd come here."""
st_010520_0020#0,"""That masked guy was spotted around here, which means the weapon should be near."""
st_010520_0030#0,"""Mystery weapon or masked guy... Either way, we should get going."""
st_010520_0040#0,"""I really don't want to be on these floating rocks any longer than I need to be."""
st_010520_0050#0,"""We're going to be here for a while, Echo. Or do you want to leave already?"""
st_010520_0060#0,"""As if! It's too dangerous to leave you and <%me> together."""
st_010520_0070#0,"""Right, whatever."""
st_010520_0080#0,"""<%me>, since we're both here, we might as well unite our efforts."""
st_010520_0090#0,"""But how should we conduct our search?"""
st_010520_0100#0,"""I guess we can just start looking around and see what turns up."""
st_010520_0110#0,"""It's pretty easy to tell if the Dragonkin are infected or not. If we keep our guard up, we'll be fine."""
st_010520_0120#0,"""But we'll take a completely safe, non-frightening route, right?"""

st_010520_0210#0,"""So, someone is waiting for you west of here?"""
st_010520_0220#0,"""It doesn't seem like a trap, but I'll leave it up to you."""
st_010520_0230#0,"""Echo, how long do you plan on clinging to me?"""
st_010520_0240#0,"""I wasn't clinging. You looked like you were about to get violent, so I was holding you back."""
