st_010120_0060#0,"""I can only observe. I will not attempt to interfere, as I cannot."""
st_010120_0070#0,"""However, if nothing is done, then everything will be lost."""
st_010120_0080#0,"""That is why I have calculated the endless possibilities and cataloged them here."""

st_010130_0060#0,"""It must be hard to comprehend it, given all this vagueness."""
st_010130_0070#0,"""To get to the point, there is something I must request of you. """
