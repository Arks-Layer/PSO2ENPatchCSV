st_010120_0060#0,"""I can only observe. I will not attempt to interfere, as I cannot."""
st_010120_0070#0,"""However, if nothing is done, then everything will be lost."""
st_010120_0080#0,"""That is why I have calculated the endless possibilities and cataloged them here."""

st_010120_0100#0,"""I can only observe; I cannot guide you. But, perhaps, this Matter Board can."""
st_010120_0110#0,"""I pray the woeful path I have taken will help show you the way."""
st_010120_0120#0,"""I know that I do not have your trust or confidence. That is only logical."""
