st_010120_0010#0,"""I was waiting."""
st_010120_0020#0,"""No, that's not quite it. Perhaps I was making you wait."""
st_010120_0030#0,"""My name is Xion."""
st_010120_0040#0,"""I know that it will require some time before you trust me."""
st_010120_0050#0,"""And yet, I want you to hear the conclusion I've arrived at after an eternity of thinking."""
st_010120_0060#0,"""I can only observe. I will not attempt to interfere, as I cannot."""
st_010120_0070#0,"""However, if nothing is done, then everything will be lost."""
st_010120_0080#0,"""That is why I have calculated the endless possibilities and cataloged them here."""
st_010120_0090#0,"""This Matter Board categorizes chance encounters and makes them inevitable."""
st_010120_0100#0,"""I can only observe; I cannot guide you. But, perhaps, this Matter Board can."""
st_010120_0110#0,"""I pray the woeful path I have taken will help show you the way."""
st_010120_0120#0,"""I know that I do not have your trust or confidence. That is only logical."""

st_010130_0010#0,"""There is something that I must tell you. There has been a fluctuation."""
st_010130_0020#0,"""Your efforts have begun to take effect. New possibilities are coming into existence."""
st_010130_0030#0,"""This is likely an affront to destiny."""

st_010130_0050#0,"""I must apologize."""
st_010130_0060#0,"""It must be hard to comprehend it, given all this vagueness."""
st_010130_0070#0,"""To get to the point, there is something I must request of you. """
st_010130_0080#0,"""Please proceed to the planet Naberius."""
st_010130_0090#0,"""I cannot tell you the reason."""
st_010130_0100#0,"""The answer lies only in the future. I can only observe, nothing more."""

al_010010_0020#0,"""The things she's saying are as cryptic as ever. Then again, am I any better?"""
al_010010_0030#0,"""She used to talk to me through my Genesis weapon, from time to time. She always gave me the feeling that she regretted something."""
al_010010_0040#0,"""Looking back at it now, that might have been her way of apologizing to me. After all, she could see the future, how it would all end."""
al_010010_0050#0,"""...I think that when Xion spoke to you, she could see her own end coming."""
al_010010_0060#0,"""Then, her reason for giving you the Matter Board as a guide. Going to Naberius was just the first step."""
al_010010_0070#0,"""That is, there was something that she wanted to achieve."""
al_010010_0080#0,"""That \""something\"" must be connected to Xion's regret, but I suppose we'll just have to wait and see what it is."""
