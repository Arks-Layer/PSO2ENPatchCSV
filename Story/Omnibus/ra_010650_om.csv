ra_010650_0020#0,"""I know why you're here. This way."""
ra_010650_0030#0,"""I wanted to contact you from this end, but he stopped me, saying it's dangerous..."""
ra_010650_0040#0,"""Your guest is here, Rogio."""
ra_010650_0050#0,"""<%me>! We finally meet again...!"""
ra_010650_0060#0,"""Wai- no, stop! You wounds will reopen!"""
ra_010650_0070#0,"""Ouch, ouch... <%me>, you're fine. I'm so glad..."""
ra_010650_0080#0,"""I thought you've been targeted too."""
ra_010650_0090#0,"""I'll get straight to the point. ARKS is hiding something on planet Naberius."""
ra_010650_0100#0,"""They wanted to silence me, which is why I'm hiding here now."""
ra_010650_0110#0,"""But... This is embarrassing, but I can't recall how I was rescued."""
ra_010650_0120#0,"""A while ago, an ARKS member brought a wounded Rogio to me."""
ra_010650_0130#0,"""That small girl told me to hide him, and disappeared after that."""
ra_010650_0140#0,"""I'm not sure if something's happened, but I can sense danger."""
ra_010650_0150#0,"""The truth is that I was almost murdered to keep something in the dark."""
ra_010650_0210#0,"""A.P.238/3/29"""
ra_010660_0050#0,"""If there were something hidden in the tundra area, then access would be restricted."""
ra_010660_0060#0,"""However, ARKS are allowed free access to the entire area. So what red flag did I set off?"""
ra_010660_0070#0,"""The parameters I measured during the geological survey seems to be the mostly likely cause."""
ra_010660_0080#0,"""The samples from the tundra had traces of Darkers in them. And pretty deep."""
ra_010660_0090#0,"""Which would mean that Darkers have been on Naberius for quite a long time."""
ra_010660_0100#0,"""That alone might not be too surprising. But there was one more thing..."""
ra_010660_0110#0,"""That tundra itself might have been caused by Darkers."""
ra_010660_0120#0,"""I haven't been able to wrap my head around the whole picture yet."""
ra_010660_0130#0,"""However, I must have done something to touch on some secret of the ARKS."""
ra_010660_0140#0,"""A Darker is the cause of the tundra. A seemingly massive one, at that. There was something else..."""
ra_010660_0150#0,"""Sorry, I can't remember. I'll have to look into it some more."""
