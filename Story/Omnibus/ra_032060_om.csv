ra_032060_0020#0,"""It's consultation time with Huey from the Council of Six!"""
ra_032060_0030#0,"""I want to get rid of the awkward atmosphere between Claris Claes and Sara!"""
ra_032060_0040#0,"""What relationship does the duo<br>have? That I don't know! I don't want to know! And to be frank, I'm not interested!"""
ra_032060_0050#0,"""However, we mustn't leave the status quo as is! Nobody will move on in this stalemate!"""
ra_032060_0060#0,"""So, <%me>, lend me a hand!"""
ra_032060_0070#0,"""1. What do you want me to do?"""
ra_032060_0080#0,"""2. We may worsen the situation"""

ra_032060_0140#0,"""However, they must not ignore each other! If they do that, even I will weep!"""
ra_032060_0150#0,"""But, given Sara's personality, she will definitely say that Claris Claes has nothing to do with her."""
ra_032060_0160#0,"""Even so, I want to do everything in my power to help them get along! You understand, don't you?"""
