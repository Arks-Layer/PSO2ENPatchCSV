msc_010130_0010#0,"""Here, take a seat."""
msc_010130_0020#0,"""Alright, let's take it from the top."""
msc_010130_0030#0,"""I am Garoa. I'm the leader of this here village."""
msc_010130_0040#0,"""That's Aina. She's my daughter."""
msc_010130_0050#0,"""Hiya!"""
msc_010130_0060#0,"""And next to her is Manon."""
msc_010130_0070#0,"""...Hello."""
msc_010130_0080#0,"""Alright, first, let's talk about where the heck you are."""
msc_010130_0090#0,"""We call this planet Halpha."""
msc_010130_0100#0,"""And on it, we're in a village called Aerio Town."""
msc_010130_0110#0,"""Probably too small to have Town in its name, but hey."""
msc_010130_0120#0,"""North of here is Central City, the largest of its kind on Halpha."""
msc_010130_0130#0,"""True to its name, it's pretty much the center of all governing and trade. Your feet will surely carry you there one day."""
msc_010130_0140#0,"""Now, next topic..."""
msc_010130_0150#0,"""The DOLLS."""
msc_010130_0160#0,"""That Pettas Sword you were fighting earlier? It's actually one of the smaller ones."""
msc_010130_0170#0,"""We Halphians have been fighting DOLLS as long as any of us can remember."""
msc_010130_0180#0,"""If I had to give a number of years, well, let's see..."""
msc_010130_0190#0,"""They say it's been for over 500 years."""
msc_010130_0200#0,"""What she said."""
msc_010130_0210#0,"""However, there's still a lot that we really don't know about the DOLLS."""
msc_010130_0220#0,"""Why do they attack us? Where do they even come from? Nobody's got a single clue."""
msc_010130_0240#0,"""There's one thing everyone knows for sure, though: DOLLS are our enemies, each and every one of 'em."""
msc_010130_0250#0,"""While we're on the topic of mysteries, there's you Meteorn folks as well."""
msc_010130_0260#0,"""Meteorn is what we call the folks that crash down from outer space inside one of those pods like the one you were found in."""
msc_010130_0270#0,"""Manon over there, she's a Meteorn just like you."""
msc_010130_0280#0,"""Manon showed up here about six months ago, close to the same island that you did. Now, she lives here with the two of us."""
msc_010130_0290#0,"""Just like DOLLS, we've got no idea where Meteorn come from, nor for what purpose they do."""
msc_010130_0300#0,"""Why do they all seem to have no memories from before they landed here?"""
msc_010130_0310#0,"""It's true for you too, right?"""
msc_010130_0320#0,"""Well, every now and then there are rare exceptions, like Manon here."""
msc_010130_0330#0,"""...Yes, it seems that I've retained a portion of my knowledge compared to other Meteorn."""
msc_010130_0340#0,"""Yeah, Manon is super smart! She's really good with machines, and she even helps me with my studies!"""
msc_010130_0350#0,"""Some folks say that DOLLS and Meteorn might even come from the same place."""
msc_010130_0360#0,"""Even if that is true, you guys will still be allies of ours."""
msc_010130_0370#0,"""Meteorn have helped us out for many years now. That much is certain."""
msc_010130_0380#0,"""Anyways, I think that's about enough for the lectures."""
msc_010130_0390#0,"""All the stuff we've talked about can be found in that Mag of yours."""
msc_010130_0400#0,"""Your Mag is that thing floating next to you."""
msc_010130_0410#0,"""That Mag is way more advanced than ours are. That's another peculiar thing about Meteorn."""
msc_010130_0420#0,"""Ah, got distracted again. Let's save it for another time."""
msc_010130_0430#0,"""You hungry?"""
msc_010130_0440#0,"""Yeah."""
msc_010130_0450#0,"""Not really."""
msc_010130_0460#0,"""Alright! I'll fix you up something to eat. Feel free to take a look around the village while I get it ready."""
msc_010130_0470#0,"""Well, at least let me get you a drink."""
msc_010130_0480#0,"""I haven't had visitors in a while, so let me welcome you proper."""
msc_010130_0490#0,"""Feel free to take a look around the village while I get it ready."""
