st_020470_0010#0,"""This area looks like there was a facility here, remodeled and used by Luther."""
st_020470_0020#0,"""Wouldn't surprise me if this was his test site, abandoning it as soon as its usefulness ended."""
st_020470_0030#0,"""I find it disgusting, but we got what we came here to investigate, so I suppose I can't complain."""
st_020470_0040#0,"""Sorry, hold on a second, I'm uploading the data to Xiao right now."""
st_020470_0050#0,"""It would be much easier if he came here directly, but that's not exactly possible given the circumstances."""
st_020470_0060#0,"""Don't ask me why he never gave me a sensible reason, so it's not like I know anything either."""
st_020470_0070#0,"""Well, he's a lot easier to understand than Xion. That is, according to him."""
st_020470_0080#0,"""But I realize that Xion has her reasons for being vague, nothing can be done about that."""
st_020470_0090#0,"""Xiao told me that Xion minces words on purpose so that what she's doing can't be interpreted by anyone."""
st_020470_0100#0,"""Luther is constantly analyzing her words, so she doesn't have any choice but to talk in a convoluted way."""
st_020470_0110#0,"""With someone reading into your every word, a cryptic way of talking makes a lot of sense."""
st_020470_0120#0,"""With Xiao, it's more that he flat out sucks at communicating to begin with."""
st_020470_0130#0,"""But that doesn't really matter, does it?"""
