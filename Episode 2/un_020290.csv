un_020290_0020#0,"""Your abilities are something that are going to become more vital to ARKS sooner than later."""
un_020290_0030#0,"""It's great that you're trying your hardest, but try not to overdo yourself."""
un_020290_0040#0,"""But Darkers have really increased in this area. You being dispatched here is further proof of that."""
un_020290_0050#0,"""My intention? Simply gathering information. If the higher-ups wanted everything annihilated, they would have sent Clarissa Claes."""
un_020290_0060#0,"""The Three Heroes are also split by our respective abilities. To put it bluntly, Clarrisa Claes is blowing everything up."""
un_020290_0070#0,"""She doesn't think and simply blows everything up around her, so I suppose it suits her."""
un_020290_0080#0,"""On a side note, while her attack is extremely high, she doesn't pace herself and tires out rather quickly."""
un_020290_0090#0,"""Personally, I'm the opposite. I focus on effectiveness, so I'm more suited for drawn-out battles."""
un_020290_0100#0,"""If someone were to go on an all-out offensive, I'm not sure I'd be able to keep up. It's something I need to work on."""
un_020290_0110#0,"""As for Regius.... it's probably best not to confront him to begin with."""
un_020290_0120#0,"""Either avoid confrontation at all cost, or think on your feet during battle."""
un_020290_0130#0,"""But if I were to think of his weakness... it would be his tendency to over think, even on the battlefield."""
un_020290_0140#0,"""It might be more accurate to say that everyone has their own strength and weaknesses."""
un_020290_0150#0,"""Regius is the strongest, Clarissa Claes is the most dangerous and I'm the most troublesome."""
un_020290_0160#0,"""That's generally the reason why I get stuck with the grunt work of gathering information."""
