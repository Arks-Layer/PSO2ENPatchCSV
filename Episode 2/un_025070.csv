un_025070_0020#0,"""Two reasons. First... I didn't want to anger Xion."""
un_025070_0030#0,"""She was the one who erased the logs. She wouldn't have done that if it hadn't involved something that could put her in danger."""
un_025070_0040#0,"""Assuming that was correct, she would have likely removed us if she had known what we were up to. I had no choice."""
un_025070_0041#0,"""I'll bet initially she tracked your every move via Clarissa. But now, she only monitors you with relative caution."""
un_025070_0042#0,"""Or is it that she's not interested in you anymore? Whatever the case, if I were to show up there's no telling what she'd do."""
un_025070_0050#0,"""She's basically like my... mom. I wouldn't be able to hide from her my intentions."""

un_025070_0080#0,"""You know how when you do something you're not supposed to, you get that look? It's extremely uncomfortable."""
un_025070_0090#0,"""Of course we're not doing anything wrong, but... it feels similar, and makes it difficult for me."""
