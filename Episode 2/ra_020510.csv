ra_020510_0020#0,"""I'm also trying to go incognito right now so please don't cause a ruckus."""
ra_020510_0030#0,"""Well then, you look like you want to ask me something. What's up?"""
ra_020510_0040#0,"""You want some information? I look like I might know?"""
ra_020510_0050#0,"""HahÔºÅYou're looking in the right place! Yep, it's exactly what you think!"""
ra_020510_0060#0,"""Being an Idol gives me the benefit of having tons of information going through these ears! Everyone just tells me stuff on their own accord!"""
ra_020510_0070#0,"""Well, getting information and hearing secrets is one of the reasons I do the idol biz anyway!"""
ra_020510_0080#0,"""But, see, I'm not just there for your convenience. I'm the solution! The solution! Get it? That's my situation as an idol."""

ra_020510_0140#0,"""W-Why in the world does this kind of info have such a high security level on it?"""
ra_020510_0150#0,"""Mmm... Dang! It won't open without the man himself!"""
ra_020510_0160#0,"""What the heck is up with this, I wonder. I think this totally reeks of conspiracy."""
ra_020510_0170#0,"""Well, you generally end up involved with all the fishy things, huh?"""
ra_020510_0180#0,"""The one who classified it is Regius. That's all the info I have."""
ra_020510_0190#0,"""I'll try to look into it, but asking Regius in person is probably going to be a lot faster."""
ra_020510_0200#0,"""Mmm, right now he's out on a sortie in the Ruins of Naberius. Why not try looking there?"""
