un_025150_0020#0,"""The Photoners... Luther did a real number on the ARKS organization. The rebuilding work is keeping us extremely busy."""
un_025150_0030#0,"""Ulc has been a fantastic assistant. She knows all the circumstances, but she’s also able to remain level-headed and calm."""
un_025150_0040#0,"""Well... I went through some pretty shocking stuff and all, so I'm kinda used to it..."""
un_025150_0050#0,"""...By the way, Xiao. Are you sure you want to go public with this?"""
un_025150_0060#0,"""I'm afraid of total chaos if you reveal the truth about ARKS, the Photoners, our hidden past..."""
un_025150_0070#0,"""Chaos? Bring it on. We need to make this public so that everyone can think about where we go from here."""
un_025150_0080#0,"""I mean, all ARKS were engineered by the Photoners as tools to resist the Darkers."""
un_025150_0090#0,"""They can deny it all they want, but it's the indisputable truth... Of course, I'm not much different as one of Xion's creations..."""
un_025150_0100#0,"""What's important is not where ARKS came from but where it's headed."""
un_025150_0110#0,"""We've cut out the corruption. Now it's time for ARKS to take a hard look at its original purpose."""
un_025150_0120#0,"""Wasn't that purpose to destroy Dark Falz?"""
un_025150_0130#0,"""That's only half correct. More specifically, it's to eradicate something called the 'Profound Darkness'."""
un_025150_0140#0,"""It's the fundamental responsibility of ARKS... no, everyone who can wield photons."""
un_025150_0150#0,"""Profound... Darkness? Is that something even more dangerous than Dark Falz?"""
un_025150_0160#0,"""Let's put it this way: it created Dark Falz."""
un_025150_0170#0,"""...Say no more."""
un_025150_0180#0,"""As long as the [Profound Darkness] exists, there will be no end to the Darkers."""
un_025150_0190#0,"""But on the flip side, if it can be done away with, so will the Darkers and Dark Falz."""
un_025150_0200#0,"""So what are we waiting for? Let's take it out! So where is it anyway?"""
un_025150_0210#0,"""I don't know."""
un_025150_0220#0,"""What?"""
un_025150_0230#0,"""Stop looking at me like that. The only record we have says that the Photoners barely succeeded in sealing it."""
un_025150_0240#0,"""Where it is, what it looks like, how it can be defeated... that's all still currently under investigation."""
un_025150_0250#0,"""The [Profound Darkness]... negative photons bent on annihilation, given birth by Photoners in the height of their depravity..."""
un_025150_0260#0,"""The Photoners may have sealed it eons ago, but the Darkers and Dark Falz are what remain of it today."""
un_025150_0270#0,"""Our conflicts with those remnants allow us to gain a rough estimate of the [Profound Darkness]' strength."""
un_025150_0280#0,"""If we want this war to end, we have no choice other than to wipe it from existence."""
un_025150_0290#0,"""’[Profound Darkness]’, huh? I can't believe there's something worse than Dark Falz."""
un_025150_0300#0,"""Well if that’s the case, it’s time for some elbow grease! Now I've got to even more work to do to support you guys in the fight!!"""
un_025150_0310#0,"""Ulc? Ulc! We're not done talking here! ...She's already gone."""
un_025150_0320#0,"""Sheesh! That girl's hopelessly optimistic outlook is a real encouragement to have around."""
un_025150_0330#0,"""With her kind of effort, I begin to think anything and everything will work out in the end, no matter how illogical."""
un_025150_0340#0,"""Since Ulc has left the building, I think this is a good place to stop for today."""
