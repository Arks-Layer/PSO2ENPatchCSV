ra_020340_0010#0,"""Oh, it's you. Have you been patrolling this area? That's admirable."""
ra_020340_0020#0,"""Anyway, I have a question for you. Have you seen Claris Claes in this area?"""
ra_020340_0030#0,"""It seems the order to stand by has been issued."""
ra_020340_0040#0,"""It seems that it only applies to the Three Heroes, but more than an order, it's a recommendation."""
ra_020340_0050#0,"""But even with that kind of recommendation... She just left because she felt like it."""
ra_020340_0060#0,"""Not only does she defy orders from above, she only follows her own will..."""
ra_020340_0070#0,"""I see, I can tell from your expression."""
ra_020340_0080#0,"""Right, the order to stand by has been issued for the Three Heroes"""
ra_020340_0090#0,"""It seems that even with the order, she's acting on her own, so that's reassuring."""
ra_020340_0100#0,"""It's good that she's not just blindly obeying what she's been told to do by the higher ups."""
ra_020340_0110#0,"""She's strong, almost beyond explanation. That's just how she is."""
ra_020340_0120#0,"""Other people are afraid of her because of that, and honestly, I doubt I would stand a chance against her."""
ra_020340_0130#0,"""But even though she's in the Council of Six, she's still just a young naive child."""
ra_020340_0140#0,"""She hasn't learned what's right and what's wrong for herself yet, which is why she's constantly being used."""
ra_020340_0150#0,"""That's why I think Regius left her to me to act as an example..."""
ra_020340_0160#0,"""If I'm actually filling that role or not, I really have no idea."""
ra_020340_0170#0,"""What? Oh no! I was actually talking seriously, I can't be out of character!"""
ra_020340_0180#0,"""The world is like that! If it's wrong, fix it or something like that!"""
ra_020340_0190#0,"""I'm off! ... And um, please keep this a secret, okay? Later!"""
