st_020660_0010#0,"""...You don't seem to be weaker at all."""
st_020660_0020#0,"""That's my line. If all you do is work, then you'll get soft."""
st_020660_0030#0,"""...Huey. Why are you standing on that side? I'm on this side...!"""
st_020660_0040#0,"""Claris Claes... Can you still hear Clarissa's voice...?"""
st_020660_0050#0,"""Everyone seems to be at a loss, huh? No one's going all out, it would seem."""
st_020660_0060#0,"""Well, if Regius and Maria went all out, this place would disappear. That sort of thing... it won't happen."""
st_020660_0070#0,"""Claris Claes didn't think she'd be fighting other ARKS either, so it can't be helped."""
st_020660_0080#0,"""Keeping that in mind, the one who can fight most efficiently would be me... Not that it would go smoothly."""
st_020660_0090#0,"""<%me>. You and that lady over there are magnificently skilled. Leaving everyone else aside, I applaud you."""
st_020660_0100#0,"""However, the one over there, frankly, is a let-down... or rather, out of her league."""
st_020660_0110#0,"""Sh... Shut up...!"""
st_020660_0120#0,"""Looking at your gifts, you have an aptitude for supporting roles, but trying close combat... Are you trying to imitate Zeno, perhaps?"""
st_020660_0130#0,"""Even him, when stretching his talents too thin, fell short in his battle against Elder..."""
st_020660_0140#0,"""Won't acting like that just hold back people like <%me> and them?"""
st_020660_0150#0,"""But then... I can't protect anyone."""
st_020660_0160#0,"""I don't know if Zeno survived, but if I can't protect anyone else... What's the point?"""
st_020660_0170#0,"""That's why Zeno stood in front. Not with a gun, but with a sword. Before anyone else, in front of everyone..."""
st_020660_0180#0,"""Even if it's as you say, even if I become a burden... I won't let you reject that ideal!"""
st_020660_0190#0,"""It's not like I don't understand what you're saying."""
st_020660_0200#0,"""However, you can't let yourself get provoked so easily."""
st_020660_0210#0,"""Zeno!"""
st_020660_0220#0,"""Well said, Echo."""
st_020660_0230#0,"""Oooh, right at the scary part. Looks like the easygoing one was right."""
st_020660_0240#0,"""That's..."""
st_020660_0250#0,"""...Ha, you finally came."""
st_020660_0260#0,"""That crest... Number Four of the Six? That seat... it should have been empty?"""
st_020660_0270#0,"""Not everything Clarissa says is true, Claris Claes."""
st_020660_0280#0,"""Ah......."""
st_020660_0290#0,"""Yo, <%me>. Also, Echo, long time no see."""
st_020660_0300#0,"""......"""
st_020660_0310#0,"""My bad, I got delayed on my way here. This weapon, it doesn't seem to like to listen to me, so I barely got here on time..."""
st_020660_0320#0,"""......"""
st_020660_0330#0,"""Oi, Echo? Echooooo? Ms. Echo?"""
st_020660_0340#0,"""Zeno..."""
st_020660_0350#0,"""Oh, you finally responded. I thought you forgotten my face after so long,  but it looks like I jumped to conclusions."""
st_020660_0360#0,"""Tss!"""
st_020660_0370#0,"""...Ow! What was that for?!"""
st_020660_0380#0,"""Idiot! Idiotidiotidiot! If you were alive then you should've contacted me! You should've come right back!"""
st_020660_0390#0,"""S- shut up! I had a situation of my own, you know!"""
st_020660_0400#0,"""I almost got killed over and over again by Ane-san!"""
st_020660_0410#0,"""Disrespectful. You almost died on your own, didn't you?"""
st_020660_0420#0,"""I don't care about that, idiot! Do... Do you know how long I waited for you?!"""
st_020660_0430#0,"""Do you have any idea how lonely I was?! Just how scared I was?!"""
st_020660_0440#0,"""Just how... scared... did you think I was, you idiot?!"""
st_020660_0450#0,"""...I'm sorry."""
st_020660_0460#0,"""Forgive me for now. Before you get spitting mad at me, there's something that has to be done."""
st_020660_0462#0,"""...I mean, haven't you had it hard up until now?"""
st_020660_0464#0,"""...haha. As always, I can't hide anything from Zeno."""
st_020660_0466#0,"""You've endured too much. Don't push yourself too hard."""
st_020660_0468#0,"""...Okay."""
st_020660_0470#0,"""'cuse me, miss. Sorry, but could you hold onto Echo for a bit?"""
st_020660_0480#0,"""Ah, y-yes!"""
st_020660_0490#0,"""...Zeno!"""
st_020660_0500#0,"""Huh?"""
st_020660_0510#0,"""It's been a while since you took center stage, huh? Use all your strength! Do him in!"""
st_020660_0520#0,"""Yeah!"""
st_020660_0530#0,"""Long time no see, Casra. I didn't think I'd be greeting you with a gunshot, though."""
st_020660_0540#0,"""The same goes for me. I didn't imagine you would survive that situation."""
st_020660_0550#0,"""It's thanks to <%me> that I barely got out with my life."""
st_020660_0560#0,"""That's why I gotta repay the favor."""
st_020660_0570#0,"""New Number Four of the Six... as you'll be known from here on, huh? With this, the Even Numbers are complete."""
st_020660_0580#0,"""And that Commandment Sword Nanaki... I never thought someone would appear that could wield it."""
st_020660_0590#0,"""Right? Looks like being a Hunter wasn't a complete waste, then."""
st_020660_0600#0,"""...There's no mistake. Allow me to withdraw my previous statement. From here on out... this is the real deal."""
st_020660_0610#0,"""Expressive Wisp... Florenbelc."""
st_020660_0620#0,"""<%me>...Looks like Mr. Slave's getting serious."""
st_020660_0630#0,"""Then, in that case, let's show him some teacher & student teamwork."""
st_020660_0640#0,"""Sword of the Resounding Commandment... Nanaki!"""
st_020660_0650#0,"""...Hey, Claris Claes. Are you having fun?"""
st_020660_0660#0,"""......"""
st_020660_0670#0,"""Don't you always say that? You want to do fun stuff, right? What about now? Is it fun?"""
st_020660_0680#0,"""......ah!"""
st_020660_0690#0,"""Oi, can you hear me...? Answer me, Claris Claes!"""
st_020660_0700#0,"""Shut up, shutupshutupshutup! Don't deceive me! Don't question me! I'm fine as long as I have Clarissa!"""
st_020660_0710#0,"""Clarissa teaches me everything... everything is fine! Stuff like being wrong, won't happen!"""
st_020660_0720#0,"""...I see."""
st_020660_0730#0,"""Then playtime is over. I am Number Six of the Six, and you are Number Five of the Six, Claris Claes, and I will stop you."""
st_020660_0740#0,"""Wake up and smash... Walfran!"""
st_020660_0750#0,"""Steel your heart, Claris Claes! This... is what you call hostility!"""
