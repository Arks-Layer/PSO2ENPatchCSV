un_020640_0020#0,"""What you just said really has nothing to do with anything, but whatever, Tea here."""
un_020640_0030#0,"""Introducing myself and where we are at the same time, two birds with one stone, right?"""
un_020640_0040#0,"""But still, the sacred grounds to the Dragonkin, this Dragon Altar, I never expected to be able to enter here."""
un_020640_0050#0,"""You're right, we may be here to get rid of Dragonkin infected by Darkers, but I suppose that means they trust us."""
un_020640_0060#0,"""The reason that the Dragonkin are able to trust us is really all because of you."""
un_020640_0070#0,"""Because the Elder Dragonkin have recognized you, they've also allowed other ARKS to enter this area."""
un_020640_0080#0,"""Those are results that I think you should be proud of, but from the perspective of the higher ups, it might be suspicious."""
un_020640_0090#0,"""Yeah, that's so rude, you're the one who got rid of the Dragonkin's grudge against us, you think that'd be commendable!"""
un_020640_0100#0,"""But still, you can't let your guard down! It's not like all of the Dragonkin are friendly, that woman said something like that."""
un_020640_0110#0,"""There are still a lot of Dragonkin who view ARKS as an enemy, so be careful as you progress through here!"""
un_020640_0120#0,"""After that, we were bored to tears being lectured for nearly an hour about the Dragonkin."""
