un_020100_0020#0,"""Void Facilities!<br>That's the division of that laboratory that everyone was talking about!"""
un_020100_0030#0,"""As of now, Patty has made this information clear!"""
un_020100_0040#0,"""Hello! Tea here, but it seems I've gotten tired of getting mad at you for being a loud mouth."""
un_020100_0050#0,"""It's been a while since we've had this good information, and yet you seem down Tea!"""
un_020100_0060#0,"""After digging, this is the name that we were finally able to get hold of, you should be happier!"""
un_020100_0070#0,"""Yeah, but still it seems that just saying lab, or laboratory seems more descriptive..."""
un_020100_0080#0,"""But it seems that wasn't the only thing that has come out of Void Facilities."""
un_020100_0090#0,"""It seems that every time a shift happens within ARKS, Void Facilities is doing something in the shadows."""
un_020100_0100#0,"""Shadow overlords, there's something like that going on inside of ARKS?"""
un_020100_0110#0,"""Of course, it seems that they make lots of things that are beneficial to ARKS as well though."""
un_020100_0120#0,"""Newmans, Casts, and even Mags it seems are all products of Void Facilities' research."""
un_020100_0130#0,"""With a name like Void Facilities, it seems like it's some kind of diversion!"""
un_020100_0140#0,"""It's wrong to judge something just by its name, but for once I'm with Patty on this one."""
un_020100_0150#0,"""Suddenly with new bit of information, the game seems to get a lot more suspicious!"""
un_020100_0160#0,"""Everything we've hit up to now has been nothing but dust."""
un_020100_0170#0,"""Mumumu, my antenna for suspicion is going off! Tea, I'm off to investigate more!"""
un_020100_0180#0,"""Hey, Patty wait! Excuse me, I need to catch up."""
