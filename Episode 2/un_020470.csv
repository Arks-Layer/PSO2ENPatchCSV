un_020470_0020#0,"""A planet with a large body of water stretching across it? An ocean planet?"""
un_020470_0030#0,"""Inside this ship, there's an artificial ocean, but I wonder what a natural ocean is like."""
un_020470_0040#0,"""The ocean is really wonderful. There's something about the sound of waves that makes you feel calm inside."""
un_020470_0050#0,"""I've only seen waves in recorded video data, but somehow, there's something nostalgic about it."""
un_020470_0060#0,"""It's said that the ocean is the origin of life, so maybe it has something to do with that?"""
un_020470_0070#0,"""If this world is ever peaceful, I'd love to have a chance to swim in a natural ocean sometime."""
un_020470_0080#0,"""Ah, sorry. I know you're not going there to play or anything."""
un_020470_0090#0,"""But still, I wonder if being able to see somewhere like that is a special privilege for ARKS."""
un_020470_0100#0,"""I'm a little jealous. Sometimes, I think of how much I'd like to go somewhere with you..."""
