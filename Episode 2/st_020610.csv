st_020610_0020#0,"""I've been waiting, you two."""
st_020610_0030#0,"""We have come so far, and the end is in sight. This will be the final request from me to you."""

st_020610_0150#0,"""These unnecessary \""branches\"" and \""pests\"" can simply be left to rot. You think so too, don't you? Xion?"""
