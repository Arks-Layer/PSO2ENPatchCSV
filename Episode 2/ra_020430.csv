ra_020430_0010#0,"""Oh, it's you..."""
ra_020430_0020#0,"""So you're also doing quests in this area. Quite diligent, aren't you."""
ra_020430_0030#0,"""Me? I guess you could say, I'm containing people moving around here."""
ra_020430_0040#0,"""Fufu, I suppose that saying it like that gives you an idea of whose side I'm on."""

ra_020430_0120#0,"""I'll merely say, be careful. It's not my responsibility to look after you should something happen."""
