st_020700_0010#0,"""Hey, Regius. Can you hear me? Well well, that was an amazing broadcast wasn't it?"""
st_020700_0020#0,"""That girl, she was so obedient in continuing her idol work, or so I thought. I see, it was all for this moment."""
st_020700_0030#0,"""Seeing her work so hard was very amusing to me."""
st_020700_0040#0,"""Luther... is that all? We're in the middle of a battle here."""
st_020700_0050#0,"""Ah. Of course, that's not all."""
st_020700_0060#0,"""It seems like you're having a tough time over there. I thought I'd send you a present."""
st_020700_0070#0,"""They're things I no longer need. Cutting them or breaking them, I don't mind. Just do as you wish."""
st_020700_0080#0,"""...! Everyone, defend!"""
st_020700_0090#0,"""......huh?"""
st_020700_0100#0,"""Seems like they got there safely. Making them was easy, but adjusting them was a hassle."""
st_020700_0110#0,"""I was looking for the proper timing to punish you all."""
st_020700_0120#0,"""...Luther! You bastard!"""
st_020700_0130#0,"""Do you hate me? But, I'm not a Darker, you know?"""
st_020700_0140#0,"""You ARKS who were created to eliminate Darkers... is it okay to hate the non-Darker me?"""
st_020700_0150#0,"""I'll see you later then, Regius. This evening, could you not disturb my date with her?"""
st_020700_0160#0,"""......"""
st_020700_0170#0,"""Releasing all the Claris Claes-type clones at once...that's a gaudy way to mimic someone."""
st_020700_0180#0,"""That... what... what are those... I don't know those, I don't know!"""
st_020700_0190#0,"""I...I'm right here? Then, who's the me over there?"""
st_020700_0200#0,"""Bastard...who? Who are you?"""
st_020700_0210#0,"""Tell me, tell me, Clarissa. Clarissa...Clarissaaaa..."""
st_020700_0220#0,"""Reply, Clarissa...! Why are you silent...? Why won't you tell me..."""
st_020700_0230#0,"""No, no, NO!"""
st_020700_0240#0,"""I'm scared, scared, scared scared scared..."""

st_020700_0300#0,"""...It's alright. You don't have to hold it in. It was painful, wasn't it...?"""
st_020700_0310#0,"""Don't think for now, just rest."""
st_020700_0320#0,"""...Oi, Regius. You're not going say that you're protecting the ARKS like this, are you?"""
st_020700_0330#0,"""Actually, don't say it. If you did, I'd kill you."""
st_020700_0340#0,"""A method to free ones' self from absolute authority... It should be possible."""
st_020700_0350#0,"""In order to search for that method, I've submitted myself... because there was no other way to protect ARKS."""
st_020700_0360#0,"""However...!"""
st_020700_0370#0,"""This temporary balance... it's no longer worth protecting!"""
st_020700_0380#0,"""<%me>. You and the lady go on ahead."""
st_020700_0390#0,"""Alma's wish to continue the ARKS... the one to succeed her will is definitely you."""
st_020700_0400#0,"""All hands, your targets are the Claris Claes clones. Don't leave a single one behind."""
st_020700_0410#0,"""They might be degradations, but they're still clones just as powerful as her."""
st_020700_0420#0,"""Their powers and their weapons... The Ashen Staves Clarissa II... They're a pain."""
st_020700_0430#0,"""Yes, but a pain is all they are. They have no will of their own. Destroy all of them."""
st_020700_0440#0,"""You don't need to tell me!"""
st_020700_0450#0,"""It seems that Luther has lost all interest in the ARKS, huh? The laboratory isn't responding either."""
st_020700_0460#0,"""We feared this would happen, so we kept him on a short leash. However, I suppose he was too arrogant in his wishes."""
st_020700_0470#0,"""We didn't pay attention to his detached attitude, and as expected in the end, he stopped being human. Ugh, this whole situation sickens me."""
st_020700_0480#0,"""It's been many years since I stood with you like this, hasn't it? Not since 10 years ago, I think."""
st_020700_0490#0,"""Excluding the Elder War, I believe. I sincerely thank you for biding your time and training our juniors, Maria."""
st_020700_0500#0,"""I was just doing what I want. If anything, you're the one that put up with everything, Regius."""
st_020700_0510#0,"""It's our turn now. Come, Laviulis!"""
