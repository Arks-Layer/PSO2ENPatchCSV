un_020370_0010#0,"""Oh, hello comrade! Have you heard that there's a newly unlocked class?"""
un_020370_0020#0,"""It's called the Braver class! It turns out someone in ARKS did their best to submit a new class."""
un_020370_0030#0,"""But it's still new, so it will likely take some time to get accustomed to it."""
un_020370_0040#0,"""That's why it's best to party with a Hunter, to act as a base while you gain experience."""
un_020370_0050#0,"""On the other hand, I wouldn't party with a Force. They're fragile, and you might not be able to protect them."""
un_020370_0060#0,"""In other words, it would put both of you in danger, but that depends on who you're with..."""
un_020370_0065#0,"""It really does depend on who you party with, I had a lot of trouble back at the ARKS Battle Tournament...."""
un_020370_0070#0,"""Anyways, my recommendation is that you start off paired with a Hunter, that way seems safest."""
un_020370_0080#0,"""Keep that in mind. I'll see you around."""
