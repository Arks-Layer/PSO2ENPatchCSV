st_020080_0010#0,"""Impressive. That was definitely a great performance to be able to take care of that many with ease."""
st_020080_0020#0,"""Oh, you were at that place before, and you're here now. Xion must have put you up to this."""
st_020080_0023#0,"""I don't know exactly what she's thinking, but it's already too late."""
st_020080_0026#0,"""But it doesn't matter, I have no business with you today. It's with this young man here."""
st_020080_0030#0,"""What do you want? I have no time for a leisurely talk with you."""
st_020080_0040#0,"""I still have a lot more Darkers that I need to destroy."""
st_020080_0050#0,"""Impressive. You sure sound like the model example of the principles of ARKS."""
st_020080_0060#0,"""Darkers are a problem for me. That's why I came here to ask for your help in dealing with them."""
st_020080_0070#0,"""Your power is truly amazing. But at the moment, it's only that of your individual strength."""
st_020080_0080#0,"""Don't you want more power? Power that would even rival that of the council of six?"""
st_020080_0090#0,"""The power to be able to kill everything that you so desire?"""
st_020080_0100#0,"""Power to destroy everything I desire?"""
st_020080_0110#0,"""I'm not a person with enough free time to sit around waiting for an answer."""
st_020080_0120#0,"""I just came to give you the offer. If you can't make up your mind, then I'll head back."""
st_020080_0130#0,"""Wait."""
st_020080_0140#0,"""Don't decide that I can't make up my mind on your own."""
st_020080_0150#0,"""Hm?"""
st_020080_0160#0,"""You don't need to worry about me. Getting stronger is one of the main duties of ARKS, right?"""
st_020080_0170#0,"""I need to be stronger than anyone else, and make them pay for what they did to her."""
st_020080_0180#0,"""That's what I've decided, I need to get strong enough for her to be able to forgive me."""
st_020080_0190#0,"""If I keep going on like this, it might make her happy."""
st_020080_0200#0,"""I'd appreciate it if you didn't glare at me like that. This is his decision, after all."""
st_020080_0210#0,"""Respecting other people's decisions is part of what you call friendship, right?"""
