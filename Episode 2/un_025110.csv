un_025110_0030#0,"""...I know. Um, ...<%me>."""
un_025110_0040#0,"""I apologize for all the trouble I caused you."""
un_025110_0050#0,"""1. Luther was the one at fault."""
un_025110_0060#0,"""2. How are you feeling?"""
un_025110_0070#0,"""No, he's not the only one to blame. If only I had kept a stronger mental grip..."""

un_025110_0140#0,"""All that's left is yourself. You need to accept what you've become because you'll have to live with it. No more putting yourself down allowed!"""
