st_020195_0010#0,"""〔Xiao, it seems your time has come to meet <%me>.〕"""
st_020195_0020#0,"""Thank you for preparing this area."""
st_020195_0030#0,"""〔Think nothing of it. A favor is a favor. This is how the Dragonkin shows its appreciation. May we meet again.〕"""
st_020195_0040#0,"""Understood. Wait for some good news."""
st_020195_0050#0,"""Nice work Sara. And by the way, I overheard everything you said along the way."""
st_020195_0060#0,"""I said it specifically so you would hear it."""
st_020195_0070#0,"""You really have an interesting upbringing."""
st_020195_0080#0,"""It's probably because of the people I am surrounded by."""
st_020195_0090#0,"""It seems that simply being around you lowers my selfworth-"""
st_020195_0100#0,"""If you finish that sentence, I'm going to hate you forever."""
st_020195_0110#0,"""What do you mean? It was you who said that banter like this would make me appear more human, correct?"""
st_020195_0120#0,"""A-Anyway, there was something you needed to explain. There's no time, right?"""
st_020195_0130#0,"""I really have bad luck with the people I meet... But to introduce myself-"""
st_020195_0140#0,"""My name is Xiao. It's nice to meet you, <%me>. I've heard you've been getting along with Xion."""
st_020195_0150#0,"""To put it simply, I am like Xion's younger brother."""
st_020195_0160#0,"""My goal is her freedom."""
st_020195_0162#0,"""Sorry for calling you all the way out here. It was the only way to avoid being noticed by Luther."""
st_020195_0164#0,""" I asked a lot from Kamitsu of Ro, and caused the Dragonkin a lot of trouble, but I was able to meet you."""
st_020195_0166#0,"""The person Xion has a vested interest in."""
st_020195_0170#0,"""As you can probably tell, ARKS is in a pretty bad state. It's pretty much Luther's puppet."""
st_020195_0180#0,"""But the fact that it still shows some semblance of an organization shows that Luther doesn't completely understand Xion."""
st_020195_0190#0,"""The reason she doesn't use ordinary language is so that Luther can't understand her."""
st_020195_0200#0,"""As such, it must be hard for you to understand as well. So I have to apologize for that much."""
st_020195_0210#0,"""But you've gotten used to it a little, and what she says is starting to make sense, correct?"""
st_020195_0220#0,"""I guess she is coming closer to being human in her own way."""
st_020195_0230#0,"""But that also means that it's easier for Luther to understand her as well. So, we don't have a lot of time."""
st_020195_0240#0,"""That's why I'm trying to act, and working with Sara. I would like for you to act as well."""
st_020195_0250#0,"""To return ARKS to the organization it needs to be."""
st_020195_0260#0,"""It sounds like a lie right? That's what I thought at first, and that it didn't concern me. But it's not a lie."""
st_020195_0270#0,"""I really don't like this kid, and he pisses me off making me do things. Even so, what he said just now is the truth."""
st_020195_0280#0,"""Sara, you still don't understand. I've changed according to your impact, so you might as well be insulting yourself."""
st_020195_0290#0,"""If it hurts you, then I don't mind a little pain in the process."""
st_020195_0300#0,"""Can't say I disrespect that attitude of hurting others at your own expense. I'll sing in your head all night tonight."""
st_020195_0310#0,"""You want to start something? Pull something like that and I'll sing you a elegy."""
st_020195_0320#0,"""Looks like we got off point again. Are you trying to kill my credibility?"""
st_020195_0330#0,"""And whose fault is that?"""
st_020195_0340#0,"""Well, it's not <%me>'s fault."""
st_020195_0350#0,"""Anyways, hearing all of this at once might not be easy to handle."""
st_020195_0360#0,"""That's why I wanted to show you at least some evidence, so that the outcome can be changed."""
st_020195_0370#0,"""Okay, that's it. Now all you need to do is head for the ruins on Naberius."""
st_020195_0380#0,"""That day, the time when Dark Falz gets revived, change it a little so no one notices."""
st_020195_0390#0,"""The day before you met with Maria and Sara, right. That's your goal."""
st_020195_0400#0,"""Don't worry, I'll make the time sync up. All you need to do is what you do normally."""
st_020195_0410#0,"""Then, all you need to do is change one thing. It may not seem like much, but down the line it will make a huge difference."""
st_020195_0420#0,"""Xiao, we're almost out of time."""
st_020195_0430#0,"""Yes, I know."""
st_020195_0440#0,"""This is the limit on what I can explain. To believe it or not... is up to you."""
st_020195_0450#0,"""But for what it's worth, I believe in you."""
