un_025010_0020#0,"""It's complicated by the fact that Xion sent her on so many missions across different planets..."""
un_025010_0030#0,"""What'cha doin'? Are you two up to no good?"""
un_025010_0040#0,"""Matoi!?"""
un_025010_0050#0,"""Why the surprise, Xiao? ...you were up to no good, weren't you?"""
un_025010_0060#0,"""N-no way! This is strictly business! On the topic, why are you here? You're supposed to be getting your physical."""
un_025010_0070#0,"""Ah--uh, Ahem! I had something important to ask!"""
un_025010_0080#0,"""Basically...I want to be a member of ARKS! What do I need to do?"""
un_025010_0090#0,"""...ARKS? But you were already a---"""
un_025010_0100#0,"""Excuse me. How to become an ARKS, was it? Normally, you enter the academy, and depending on your performance, you make the cut."""
un_025010_0110#0,"""But that takes two YEARS! I don't want to wait, I want it now!"""
un_025010_0120#0,"""...then, the only other way would be by special exemption. In your case, no one would doubt your particular aptitude."""
un_025010_0130#0,"""Special exemption?"""
un_025010_0140#0,"""Either by someone at the highest level of management, or someone with the rights to Avis, would have to grant permission. Only then can you skip the ranks and become an ARKS."""
un_025010_0150#0,"""Claris Claes and Huey are two examples... that's how they became ARKS."""
un_025010_0160#0,"""Hmm~ So you can grant me permission, Xiao!"""
un_025010_0170#0,"""...Uh...yeah, that's one way... but don't you have more important matters to take care of first?"""
un_025010_0180#0,"""He's right! To become an ARKS, you have to first be a woman of your word!"""
un_025010_0190#0,"""Ah--!? P-Philia? I, uh... that's..."""
un_025010_0200#0,"""Matoi, do you remember our conversation? I said you have to report for a physical. You said you'd go straight there. Isn't that right?"""
un_025010_0210#0,"""Ah...y-yeah... I... I'm sorry!!"""
un_025010_0220#0,"""That she wants to become an ARKS is so incredibly ironic...it's simply amazing."""
un_025010_0230#0,"""I think I will put in a request for her special exemption. It will be easier to monitor her that way."""
