un_020110_0020#0,"""Who is more suspect, ARKS? Or the rumored Void."""
un_020110_0030#0,"""Normally, people who are tired should take a rest. Tea here."""
un_020110_0040#0,"""Right when the commotion of the rampaging dragon ended, we discovered a new planet!"""
un_020110_0050#0,"""As for us, we've had nothing to do up until now, but that's all changed!"""
un_020110_0060#0,"""It seems everything is happening one after the other."""
un_020110_0070#0,"""I wanted to expose the internal problems once the dragon incident had ended!"""
un_020110_0080#0,"""I thought I'd have more time to look into it, but I've been running around doing other stuff!"""
un_020110_0090#0,"""That's just an excuse for your slacking off."""
un_020110_0100#0,"""But I have to agree with Patty on not being able to investigate into internal affairs."""
un_020110_0110#0,"""As far as Void, there's still a lot more we'd like to investigate. It seems some people have left the organization."""

un_020110_0130#0,"""Unfortunately, we haven't found anyone yet! Something unusual is probably going on!"""
un_020110_0140#0,"""If we gave up on something like this, we wouldn't be able to call ourselves information dealers!"""
un_020110_0150#0,"""All right, Tea, let's hurry up and get back to searching for more info!"""
un_020110_0160#0,"""Didn't you just say you were tired and wanted to take a break? Anyways, later."""
