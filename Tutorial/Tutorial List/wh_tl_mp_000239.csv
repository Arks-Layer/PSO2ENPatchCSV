text01#0,"""With Multi-party quests, there is a multi-party area (MPA) where multiple parties can go back and forth, and a single party area where one party can battle on it's own. <br><br>The multi-party area is a special zone designated as difficult to breach by only a stand-alone party, so entering it means flirting with danger, but that only means you can expect good returns."""
