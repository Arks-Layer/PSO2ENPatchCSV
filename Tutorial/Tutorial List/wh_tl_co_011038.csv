text02#0,"""This explains the Sword Gear system.<br><br>When you learn the skill \""Sword Gear\"", a Gear Gauge is added to the top of your Weapon Palette. Hitting enemies with Sword attacks will fill the Gear Gauge.<br><br>As the Gear Gauge fills, your Photon Arts gain increased attack range, and some Photon Arts can be charged quicker.<br><br>The Sword Gear Gauge empties slowly over time, so keep on attacking to keep the Gear Gauge filled."""
