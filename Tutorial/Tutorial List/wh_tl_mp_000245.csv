name01#0,"""PSE"""
text01#0,"""Defeating enemies stimulates the photons in the atmosphere, which affects the abilities of ARKS operatives. This effect is known as PSE (Photon Sensitive Effect).<br><br>PSE can cause anything from a simple boost in abilities, to an increase in the amount of meseta dropped, or extra experience from combat."""
text02#0,"""There are eight levels of PSE, and the level rises as you continue to defeat enemies, enhancing the effect produced.<br><br>When photons are stimulated to PSE level 8, a PSE Burst is triggered. This results in a dramatic stat boost due to the violent excitation of atmospheric photons caused by cumulative PSEs."""
text03#0,"""This effect only lasts for a limited time, but it can be extended by defeating enemies to keep photons in a state of excitation.<br><br>A sign of some kind is given just before PSE is about to occur, so keep an eye out and utilize PSE to its best effect."""
