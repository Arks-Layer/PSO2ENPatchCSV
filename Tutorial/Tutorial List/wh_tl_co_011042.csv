text01#0,"""Partizans are melee weapons that mow down the enemy with high-speed, energetic attacks.<br><br>Their flashy moves flow into each other like a dance, leaving no gaps in their attacks.<br><br><%WeaponActionText>: Guard, reducing damage taken from frontal attacks while filling the Gear Gauge. Guard just before an attack hits you to prevent all damage from that attack."""
text02#0,"""This explains the Partizan Gear system.<br><br>When you learn the skill \""Partizan Gear\"", a Gear Gauge is added to the top of your Weapon Palette.<br><br>You can fill the Gear Gauge by performing a dance action. To perform a dance action, simply wait for a moment after any attack.<br><br>You can also fill the Gear Gauge at any time by holding <%WeaponActionText> to perform a dance."""
text03#0,"""The Gear Gauge can hold up to three units of Gear. When you use a Photon Art, that Photon Art's power will be boosted and its attack range will expand, at the cost of one unit of Gear. The Gear Gauge does not empty over time.<br><br>Dance often to make use of Partizan Gear."""
