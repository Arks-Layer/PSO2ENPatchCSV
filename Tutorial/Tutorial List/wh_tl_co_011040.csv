They specialize in attacks that grab, throw and strike enemies.<br><br>When fully extended, their tricky attacks have the longest range of all melee weapons. They can also take small or medium-sized enemies out of the battle by grappling them and throwing them around.<br><br><%WeaponActionText>: Guard"""
