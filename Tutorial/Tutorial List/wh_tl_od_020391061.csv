text01#0,"""A party is a gathering of up to 4 characters who work together to complete the same quest.<br><br>When you form a party, you can see the locations and HP of the other characters in your party, making coordination much easier.<br><br>Not only can you defeat enemies much more quickly by working together, but you also receive an EXP bonus from being in a party, meaning all members can level up more quickly."""
text02#0,"""There are two types of quest: Single Party quests and Multi-Party quests. In Multi-Party quests, up to 12 characters can fight together in the same area. You will receive full EXP from enemy kills even if they are killed by someone in another party.<br><br>With 12 people working together, you will have the advantage over even the most powerful enemies."""
text03#0,"""If you want to recruit party members, be sure to edit your party settings.<br><br>・Party name<br>If you put the name and difficulty of the quest you want to play in your party's name, you will find it easier to find like-minded players.<br><br>・Playstyle<br>If you don't have anything particular in mind, it's best to set this to \""For fun\"". If you do have a specific playstyle in mind, set this to whatever describes it best."""
text04#0,"""・Party Comment<br>This lets you describe your party's goals.<br>For example: \""Leveling up\"", \""Clearing a Client Order\"" or \""Defeating a boss\"".<br><br>This is also a good place to write down any extra notes about how you plan to play.<br>For example: \""Field farming\"", \""OK to leave any time\""."""
text05#0,"""・Notes about Partners<br>If you call 3 NPC Partners, other players will be unable to join your party.<br>If you want to play with other players, select \""Open\"" under Playstyle settings. If you do, when your party is full, NPC Partners will be automatically removed to allow new players to join."""
