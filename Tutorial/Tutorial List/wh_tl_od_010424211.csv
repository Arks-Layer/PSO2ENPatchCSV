text01#0,"""This is an explanation about chain attacks. Chain attacks are a part of an attack system that inflicts great damage on hostiles by landing Photon Arts or charged Techniques after piling on standard attacks.<br><br>A chain starts when an attack scores a hit while the Gunner skill \""Chain Trigger\"" is in effect. Once a chain starts, it will continue to grow if you and your party keep scoring hits within a specific period of time."""
