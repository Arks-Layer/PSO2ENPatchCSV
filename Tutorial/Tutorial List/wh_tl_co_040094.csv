Title#0,"""About Grinding Attributes in NT Weapons"""
text01#0,"""For New Type Weapons, there's \""Attribute\"" and \""Attribute Value.\""<br><br>\""Attribute\"" refers to your weapon's elemental type.<br>\""Attribute\"" refers to the elemental value percentage of your<br>weapon."""
text02#0,"""To increase the Attribute Value, you will need to use a material weapon via grinding the weapon itself.<br><br>For this reason, the weapon <yellow>needs to be of the same rarity and<br>type<c>."""
text03#0,"""When using the same type weapon, with the same matching rarity and matching name as the target weapon, the <yellow>attribute value will increase significantly<c>.<br><br>※The value will increase even if the attributes are different in both the value and the actual elemental attributes are different.<br><br>Normal attribute values are capped at 50. However, Weapons and Eggs of ★13 in rarity have a maximum attribute value of 60."""
text04#0,"""The higher the attribute, the more damage you deal to the enemy.<br><br>Furthermore, damage that matches an enemy's attribute weakness will result in even greater damage!<br><br>The attribute is determined when you obtain a weapon, but can be changed later with support items."""
