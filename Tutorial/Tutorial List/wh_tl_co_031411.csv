text01#0,"""This explains Item Passing.<br><br>In Challenge Quests, items that you obtained can be dropped on the ground. Dropped items can be picked up by other players."""
text02#0,"""You can drop items by selecting the \""Drop\"" command on an item in your inventory that you want to drop.<br>The \""Drop\"" command becomes available after the quest starts.<br><br>When you drop an item, the dropped item disappears from your inventory and appears on the ground.<br><br>You can also pick up your own dropped items, so if you drop an item by mistake, you can just pick it up again."""
text03#0,"""Items dropped by players look different to items dropped by enemies.<br><br>In addition, the total number of items that can be dropped on the ground is 160 across all players. When the number of dropped items exceeds 160, excess items disappear, starting with the first to be dropped."""
text04#0,"""Passing items is a very effective tool for conquering Challenge Quests.<br><br>Even if you don't need an item, it may be important to a friend, so keep in contact with each other and fill in the gaps in each others' items.<br><br>You can say the name of the dropped item with <green><lt>putitem<gt><c> or <green><lt>pi<gt><c>."""
