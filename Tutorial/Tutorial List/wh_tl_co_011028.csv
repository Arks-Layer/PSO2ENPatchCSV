text01#0,"""Owning a Mag does nothing by itself. A Mag must be equipped to have an effect. To equip a Mag, open the list of Mags from the Main Menu, choose the Mag you wish to equip and select \""Equip Mag\"".<br><br>When a Mag is equipped, it grants you various effects, such as stat boosts and support in combat.<br><br>When a Pet is equipped, your Mag is hidden, but its stats and support effects will still be received as usual."""
