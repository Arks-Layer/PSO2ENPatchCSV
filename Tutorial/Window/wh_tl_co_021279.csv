text01#0,"""Support Partners are heartening characters there to help you in battle or with Client Orders. <br><br>Overall, their special characteristic is the fact that their bodies are small."""
text02#0,"""Support Partners will help you out with Client Orders. When you ask a support partner to help you with a Client Order, they will go out in search of things needed to complete that objective.<br><br>When the search is completed, they will inform you of the results. By sending Support Partners out on searches many times, their Class Level will increase, and they will be able to easily complete more difficult Orders.<br>They will also then become a big help on the battlefield."""
text03#0,"""You can change the look of a Support Partner at the Salon. The things you can change are the same as the ones you can change about the player character.<br><br>They handle accessories and hair styles the same way as player characters do. Each time you use a ticket, their options increase. (You can also put hair styles on them from the opposite gender)"""
text04#0,"""Just like Partner characters or Friend Partners, you can call Support Partners out at the Campship's Partner Terminal to go on a quest with you and battle together.<br><br>Their actions in battle differ based on their personalities."""
