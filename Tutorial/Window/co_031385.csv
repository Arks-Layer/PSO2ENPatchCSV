text01#0,"""Every time a player levels up, they receive a Skill Point (SP).<br><br>By adding SP to a Class Skill, you help make your character grow."""
text02#0,"""Each Class Skill can be leveled up by placing a Skill Point into them.<br><br>Some skills cannot be leveled until another skill has been leveled.<br><br>Since you have limited SP, it's recommended you carefully plan out what skills to grab and level.<br><br>※Some skills may require no SP to level.<br>※Some skills have a level requirement that needs to be met in order to level them."""
text03#0,"""Skills are broadly classified into the following types:<br><br>・Active Skills<br>These are skills that, once learned, can be put on your Subpalette.<br><br>・Passive Skills<br>These are skills that are automatically activated once learned.<br><br>※After learning a skill, be sure to check your Subpalette Menu to ensure that you did not forget any Active Skills you may have learned."""
text04#0,"""Not only can you use Main Class skills, but your Subclass skills as well.<br>※Some Subclass skills may not work with your Main Class.<br><br>Try to use skills that synergize with your Main Class and Subclass."""
