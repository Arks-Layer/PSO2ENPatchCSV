Title#0,"""Hero Time"""
text0001#0,"""Hero Gear is what allows you to use the skill \""Hero Time\"". When you learn the \""Hero Time\"", a shared Gear Gauge is added to all Hero weapons.<br><br>The Gear Gauge fills as you attack enemies. Using the same attack multiple times will reduce the amount of Gear you earn from that attack, but the amount will return to normal over time.<br><br>You can activate Hero Time when the Hero Gear Gauge is full. During Hero Time, the Gear Gauge slowly empties, and your attack power increases each time you hit an enemy."""
text0002#0,"""The skill \""Hero Time Finish\"" lets you perform a powerful finishing move by activating the Hero Time skill while it is already active.<br><br>Hero Time ends as soon as you use Hero Time Finish, but the attack power boost from Hero Time still applies to it.<br><br>Hero Sword, Hero Twin Machineguns and Hero Talis each have a different Hero Time Finish."""
