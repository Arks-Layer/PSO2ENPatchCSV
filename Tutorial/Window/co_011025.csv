text01#0,"""A Just Attack guarantees a critical hit and inflicts heavy damage. The enemy is also greatly staggered by the attack. Just Attack is triggered when you press the attack button just as the red glowing ring around your character disappears after attacking. You can also use a Just Attack in combination with photon arts or charged techniques."""
