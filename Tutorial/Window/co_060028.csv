text0001#0,"""When a Wand is equipped by an Etoile, it performs \""Etoile Wand\"" attacks and PAs instead of normal Wand attacks.<br><br>Etoile Wand's primary feature is that its attacks allow you to move freely while performing them, meaning combat has a great feeling of flow to it.<br><br>In addition, activating your Weapon Action during a PA changes the nature of the PA, meaning you always have options available."""
text0002#0,"""Activating Etoile Wand's Weapon Action at the correct time during a PA will alter the PA, turning it into a more powerful but shorter-range version called a \""Focus PA\"".<br><br>Assess the situation and decide whether a normal PA or a Focus PA is more appropriate."""
text0003#0,"""Etoile Wand's Weapon Action, \""Charge Protection\"", allows you to move freely while blocking enemy attacks.<br><br>In addition, if you have learned \""Etoile Wand Gear\"", you can consume the Gear Gauge to keep your guard up for longer."""
text0004#0,"""When you learn the skill \""Etoile Wand Gear\"", a Gear Gauge is added to the top of the Weapon Palette.<br><br>The Gear Gauge can be filled in the following ways:<br><yellow>・Attacking enemies<br>・Moving<br>・Just Guarding<c><br><br>You can consume the Gear Gauge to maintain your guard with your Weapon Action. If you consume enough of your Gear Gauge, you will activate the special attack \""Protect Release\""."""
text0005#0,"""Protect Release<br><yellow>・Activate Charge Protect, hold the button until you have consumed enough of your Gear Gauge, then release the button<c> to perform a powerful, wide-range attack around yourself. If you perform Protect Release while entering movement input, you will move quickly before performing the attack.<br><br>※Protect Release's power can be increased by consuming even more of the Gear Gauge before activating it."""
