If you extend a high-grade weapon, it will get weaker as a result, and more than likely will not get stronger until you extend it to a much higher level. Also, if a weapon had non-standard stats, like a Gunslash with T-ATK, or could be equipped by non-standard classes, it will lose these special properties.<br><br><yellow>Q: Where can I get Crafting Materials?<c><br>A: By desynthesizing a 7★ or higher Weapon or Unit."""
