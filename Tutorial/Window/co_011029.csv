text01#0,"""Photon Blasts are special attacks usable by Mags that have evolved into their second form or higher. When triggered, the Mag transforms into a massive creature and unleashes a powerful attack. Players fill the blast gauge required to trigger a Photon Blast by fighting with a Mag equipped. When you learn a Photon Blast, be sure to add it to your Subpalette."""
text02#0,"""Once your blast gauge is full, you can trigger a Photon Blast from the Subpalette. There are a variety of Photon Blasts, and different types are available depending on the Mag you have. Select a Photon Blast that matches your combat style."""
