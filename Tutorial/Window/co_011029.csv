text01#0,"""Photon blasts are special attacks usable by Mags that have evolved into their second form or higher. When triggered, the Mag transforms into a massive creature and unleashes a powerful attack. Players fill the blast gauge required to trigger a photon blast by fighting with a Mag equipped. When you learn a photon blast, be sure to add it to your subpalette."""
text02#0,"""Once your blast gauge is full, you can trigger a photon blast from the subpalette. There are a variety of photon blasts, and different types are available depending on the Mag you have.  Select a photon blast that matches your combat style."""
