text02#0,"""I'm assigned to ARKS Road, a tutorial program."""
text03#0,"""ARKS Road is a tutorial program that teaches basic knowledge about ARKS."""
text04#0,"""This program is highly recommended for people who are not yet used to ARKS activities."""
text05#0,"""I believe it will be easier to understand once you've seen it.<br>First, please take this."""
text06#0,"""As you fill in this stamp card, you should naturally learn more about ARKS."""
text07#0,"""In your case, you've already completed some goals. I'll stamp those in advance."""
text08#0,"""If there are any goals you haven't experienced yet, please go ahead and give them a try."""
text09#0,"""It's quite common to realize you don't know some surprisingly basic information. It's a good idea to check over it again."""
text10#0,"""If there's anything you don't understand about the tasks, I hope you'll come directly to me to ask about them."""
text00#0,"""About ARKS Road"""
text01#0,"""ARKS Road is a tutorial program made for newcomers to ARKS. As you complete goals, you'll get stamps on your card, and you'll learn game controls and functions and basic ARKS information. *Goals that you have already completed are automatically stamped."""
text02#1,"""A navigation icon is shown facing your goal on the ARKS Road. The number written beneath is the distance to your goal. If you don't know what your goal is, follow the navigation icon and you'll reach your goal. If you don't want the icon to appear, you can set it to not show in the options menu."""
text03#1,"""You can talk to Astarte about the goal you are currently working on. If you don't know what to do next, try asking Astarte. Astarte is in the central hall of the gate area."""
