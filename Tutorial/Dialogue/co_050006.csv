text01#0,"""You can now select Buster Quests from the Quest Counter.<br><br>In Buster Quests, you earn \""Buster Points\"" (BP) if you win, and lose BP if you fail or abandon the quest. Your BP are shared across all characters on your account.<br><br>When you start a Buster Quest, you will be put into a \""Grade\"" based on your current BP total, and you will then be matched with appropriate players.<br>※Quest difficulty changes based on Grade."""
text02#0,"""There are three main kinds of Buster Quest.<br><br>◆Main Match<br>Match with players of the same Grade as yourself. You will earn or lose BP based on whether you succeed or fail the quest, and your Grade will be adjusted accordingly.<br><br>You can consume 1 Main Match Boost to get a boost effect during the quest."""
text03#0,"""◆Main Match: Advanced<br>If you meet the requirements, you can start matching for a quest whose difficulty is higher than even the highest-Grade Main Match.<br><br>※You will only be matched with players who chose Main Match: Advanced.<br><br>The effect of Main Match Boosts and the loss in BP for failing the quest are the same as a normal Main Match."""
text04#0,"""◆Free Match<br>You can match with low-Grade players to help them. In this quest, you will not earn BP for winning, but you will lose BP for a defeat, with a possible loss of Grade as a result.<br><br>※As Free Match rewards are different from Main Match rewards, you cannot make progress on Collect Files here. Rewards specific to Free Matches are available.<br><br>※If you clear a Free Match, you will recover 2 Main Match boosts. You can have up to 4 at once."""
