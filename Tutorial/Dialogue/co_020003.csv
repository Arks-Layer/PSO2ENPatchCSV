text01#1,"""Support Partners are heartening characters there to help you in battle or with Client Orders.<br><br>They might be small in stature, but they are useful companions who can help you in battle and can obtain Order Items for you.<br><br>Your Support Partners' appearance and personality can be customized. Create your dream Support Partner!"""
text02#1,"""To <yellow>send a Support Partner out to search for Order Items<c>, first go to your \""My Room\"", then select \""Support Partner\"" from your \""My Room Terminal\"".<br><br>After enough time has passed, they will return from their search, and you can collect any Order Items that they found.<br>If you repeatedly send Support Partners out on searches, they will gradually level up. A stronger Support Partner will be able to successfully search for even very difficult Order Items, and can become a force to be reckoned with in battle."""
text03#1,"""You can change the look of a Support Partner the same way you do a normal character, by visiting the <yellow>Beauty Salon<c> on the second floor of the Shop Area.<br><br>All <yellow>accessories<c>, <yellow>hairstyles<c> and so on that have been <yellow>registered by a player<c> can also be used by their Support Partners.<br><br>Raise a Support Partner of your own to serve as your adventuring companion."""
text04#0,"""Just like Partner characters or Friend Partners, you can call Support Partners out at the Campship's Partner Terminal to go on a quest with you and battle together.<br><br>Their actions in battle differ based on their personalities."""
