Title#0,"""New Type and Old Type Weapons"""
text01#0,"""There are two kinds of Weapons:<br>\u3000- \""Old Type\"" Weapons<br>\u3000- \""<c 00ffff>New Type (NT)<c>\"" Weapons<br><br>Since Episode 4, a new system of weapons were<br>introduced called <c 00ffff>New Type<c> Weapons or NT Weapons."""
text02#0,"""For <c 00ffff>New Type Weapons<c>, the \""Item Details\"" tab, an EXP bar will be displayed. They will also sport a blue frame around the weapon icon.<br><br>※Some weapons will also have the suffix \""<c 00ff00>-NT<c>\"" which will also denote that they're a New Type Weapon."""
text03#0,"""With New Type Weapons, they offer much better stats and performance than the Old Type Weapons.<br><br>Various enemies as well as the \""Collect File,\"" drop these NT<br>Weapons."""
Title#1,"""Grinding NT Weapons"""
text01#1,"""You can upgrade weapons at the Item Lab. Upgrading allows you to customize your weapons and armor units."""
text02#1,"""You need the following to perform an upgrade:<br><br>- A grinder<br>- Meseta<br>- Another NT Weapon<br>Note that they will be used up in the process of upgrading weapons and armor."""
text03#1,"""Upgrading may succeed or it may fail. When it succeeds, item performance improves. When it fails, there is a chance that item performance may decline."""
text04#0,"""A successful grind will display its new grind level compared to its previous grind level."""
text05#0,"""The greater number of weapons added, the greater the EXP bonus on the success.<br><br>You can also increase the success rate by using a \""Support Item\"", such as a \""Great Grind Success Rate-type\"" item."""
text06#0,"""After the weapon has been strengthened, the weapon's name will then show the grind level appended to the end of its name.<br><br>\u3000\u3000Example: \""(Weapon Name)+1\""<br><br>This denotes that the weapon has been grinded to its first level."""
Title#2,"""Unlocking Potentials in NT Weapons"""
text01#2,"""Just like their Old-Type counterparts, New-Type weapons also have an unlockable \""<yellow>Potential Ability<c>\"".<br><br>These Potential Abilities all have a unique criteria in which they activate.<br><br>However, in order to use these abilities, New-Type weapons have to be at a certain grind condition for them to unlock as follows:<br><br><yellow>\u3000From Grind Level \""+10\"" → \""+11\""<br>\u3000From Grind Level \""+20\"" → \""+21\""<br>\u3000From Grind Level \""+30\"" → \""+31\""<c><br><br>At each of these conditions, a \""Potential Ability\"" will automatically unlock."""
text02#2,"""To unlock a Potential Ability, materials components such as a \""Photon Crystal\"" and Meseta are required."""

text01#3,"""For New Type Weapons, there's \""Attribute\"" and \""Attribute Value.\""<br><br>\""Attribute\"" refers to your weapon's elemental type.<br>\""Attribute\"" refers to the elemental value percentage of your<br>weapon."""
text02#3,"""To increase the Attribute Value, you will need to use a material weapon via grinding the weapon itself.<br><br>For this reason, the weapon <yellow>needs to be of the same rarity and<br>type<c>."""
text03#3,"""When using the same type weapon, with the same matching rarity and matching name as the target weapon, the <yellow>attribute value will increase significantly<c>.<br><br>※The value will increase even if the attributes are different in both the value and the actual elemental attributes are different.<br><br>Normal attribute values are capped at 50. However, Weapons and Eggs of ★13 in rarity have a maximum attribute value of 60."""
text04#1,"""The higher the attribute, the more damage you deal to the enemy.<br><br>Furthermore, damage that matches an enemy's attribute weakness will result in even greater damage!<br><br>The attribute is determined when you obtain a weapon, but can be changed later with support items."""
text00#1,"""The Overgrind Limit"""
text01#4,"""For New-Type weapons, their grind cap is at \""+30\"".<br><br>When a weapon has a grind level of \""+30\"", its Potential Ability level is at \""Lv.3\"" as well."""

text00#2,"""Special Ability Factors"""
text01#5,"""Some NT weapons will have a <c 00ffff>\""Special Ability Factor\""<c> when their grind level reaches \""+35\"".<br><br>These Special Ability Factors are unique Special Abilities that you can select when you add \""Special Abilities\""."""

text01#6,"""There are 3 types of attack power:<br>S-ATK, R-ATK and T-ATK.<br><br>S-ATK affects melee attacks from striking weapons.<br>R-ATK affects ranged attacks from shooting weapons.<br>T-ATK affects attacks that use Techniques.<br><br>The higher the value of the parameter, the more damage you deal with those types of attacks."""
text02#6,"""Also, with higher DEX, damage variance is tightened, meaning damage will be higher more consistently.<br><br>There are also 3 types of defense power:<br>S-DEF, R-DEF and T-DEF, each of which has the effect of reducing one type of damage.<br>By raising DEX, you can reduce the damage you receive."""
Title#4,"""Attributes"""
text01#7,"""There are 6 Attributes: Fire, Ice, Lightning, Wind, Light and Dark.<br><br>A weapon with an Attribute will deal additional damage to enemies, which will be increased even further against enemies that are weak to that Attribute."""
