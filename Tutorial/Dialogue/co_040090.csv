Title#0,"""New-Type and Old-Type Weapons"""
text01#0,"""There are two kinds of weapons:<br>・\""Old-Type\"" weapons<br>・\""<c 00ffff>New-Type (NT)<c>\"" weapons<br><br>In Episode 4, a new system of weapons were introduced called <c 00ffff>New-Type<c> weapons or NT weapons."""
text02#0,"""For <c 00ffff>New-Type weapons<c>, an EXP bar will be displayed in the \""Item Details\"" tab. They will also sport a blue frame around the weapon icon.<br><br>※Some weapons will also have the suffix \""<c 00ff00>-NT<c>\"" which will also denote that they're a New-Type weapon."""
text03#0,"""New-Type weapons offer much better stats and performance than equivalent Old-Type weapons.<br><br>Various enemies, as well as the \""Collect File\"" system, drop these NT weapons."""
Title#1,"""Grinding NT Weapons"""
text01#1,"""New-Type Weapons can be enhanced by Grinding them at the Item Lab.<br><br>New-Type weapons use other weapons as material, consuming them to gain \""Grind EXP\"".<br><br>When the Grind EXP gauge fills, the weapon's <yellow>Grind Value<c> rises and it becomes stronger."""

Title#2,"""Unlocking Potentials in NT Weapons"""
text01#2,"""Just like their Old-Type counterparts, New-Type weapons also have an unlockable \""<yellow>Potential Ability<c>\"".<br><br>A Potential Ability is an extra ability that depends on the weapon.

text02#6,"""Also, with higher DEX, damage variance is tightened, meaning damage will be higher more consistently.<br><br>There are also 3 types of defense power:<br>S-DEF, R-DEF and T-DEF, each of which has the effect of reducing one type of damage.<br>By raising DEX, you can reduce the damage you receive."""
Title#4,"""Attributes"""
text01#7,"""There are 6 Attributes: Fire, Ice, Lightning, Wind, Light and Dark.<br><br>A weapon with an Attribute will deal additional damage to enemies, which will be increased even further against enemies that are weak to that Attribute."""
