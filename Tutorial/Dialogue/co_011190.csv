text04#0,"""As you progress through the game, your character may get requests on occasion. These are called 'Client Orders'. <br><br>The nature of the clients requests vary, and may involve things like taking instructions to clear a certain quest or being asked to gather certain items."""
text05#0,"""In the case of defeating enemies and gathering their items, if you have not received a client order to do so, they will not drop their items.<br><br>Make sure to inform the individual once the objective have been achieved. You can receive an expression of gratitude. <br><br>Once you've progressed further in the game, you can try to talk to other characters. You might be able to get new client orders."""
