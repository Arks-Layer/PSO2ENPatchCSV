Title#0,"""Supplying Fordoran Horns"""
Explanation#0,"""You won't believe this. While I was<br>preparing the Nordiran meat, I<br>accidentally threw out the horns. This<br>might sound strange, but if you grind<br>their horns into a fine powder, you get<br>a really potent spice. Anyway, I'm not<br>going to give up. Forget the Nordiran<br>horns, get me some Fordoran horns,<br>CHOP CHOP!<br><yellow>â€»Drops from Lv.24+ Fordorans.<c>"""
