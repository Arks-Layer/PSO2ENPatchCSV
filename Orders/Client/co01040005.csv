Title#0,"""Supplying Rockbear Meat"""
Explanation#0,"""Personally, I like my meat nice and<br>tender. However, a lot of your friends<br>in the ARKS have been asking for a meat<br>that's tough. I hear there's a creature<br>called a Rockbear? I wonder if their meat<br>does justice to their namesake. I can't<br>believe anyone would want to eat<br>something like that though. Who knows,<br>maybe this will make me famous.<br><yellow>â€»Drops from Lv.21+ Rockbears.<c>"""
