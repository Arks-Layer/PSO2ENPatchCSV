ssc_504060_0010#0,"""Alright, let's continue."""
ssc_504060_0020#0,"""After the Starless attack 500 years ago,<br>people learned of a grave danger."""
ssc_504060_0030#0,"""From these people, the Resurgent ARKS came into being."""
ssc_504060_0040#0,"""I believe that's where we left off, yes?<br>Faria, would you continue?"""
ssc_504060_0050#0,"""Yes."""
ssc_504060_0060#0,"""Various movements formed in an effort to<br>combat the threat of the Starless."""
ssc_504060_0070#0,"""One of those movements<br>was headed by Zephetto."""
ssc_504060_0080#0,"""He was one of the participants<br>in the fight against the Starless."""
ssc_504060_0090#0,"""Zephetto and his allies were concerned with the weakened military,<br>as well as the diminished Photon strength of the people of the time."""
ssc_504060_0100#0,"""Weakened military?"""
ssc_504060_0110#0,"""Diminished Photon strength?"""
ssc_504060_0120#0,"""Apparently, after a great war that happened 1000 years ago,<br>there was a long era of peace."""
ssc_504060_0130#0,"""Because of that, there wasn't<br>much need for military strength."""
ssc_504060_0140#0,"""This also attributed to a general<br>diminishing of Photon strength."""
ssc_504060_0150#0,"""There was a great war that happened 1000 years ago,<br>and it brought about a long era of peace."""
ssc_504060_0160#0,"""People in general no longer fought, and as such,<br>average Photon strength waned over the generations."""
ssc_504060_0170#0,"""Same goes for their military strength.<br>There's little need for an army if there are no enemies."""
ssc_504060_0180#0,"""To combat the Starless, Zephetto's team learned of the<br>strongest fighting force from the war 1000 years ago."""
ssc_504060_0190#0,"""They were called \""ARKS\""."""
ssc_504060_0200#0,"""To resurrect the power of these ARKS,<br>he created an organization..."""
ssc_504060_0210#0,"""And so began the history of Resurgent ARKS."""
ssc_504060_0220#0,"""Zephetto claimed that the Starless<br>would very likely return in 500 years."""
ssc_504060_0230#0,"""He spread word of their return, advocating that<br>the ARKS were our best chance to fight against them."""
ssc_504060_0240#0,"""And so, those who saw merit in his words joined<br>him under the banner of the Resurgent ARKS."""
ssc_504060_0250#0,"""Why did he say the Starless would return in 500 years?"""
ssc_504060_0260#0,"""Could Zephetto see into the future or something?"""
ssc_504060_0270#0,"""Zephetto personally researched<br>the movements of the Starless."""
ssc_504060_0280#0,"""He discovered that there were remarkable space-time fluctuations<br>happening throughout the universe at regular intervals."""
ssc_504060_0290#0,"""Some of fluctuations were small,<br>while other fluctuations were large."""
ssc_504060_0300#0,"""What happened 500 years ago was a small fluctuation."""
ssc_504060_0310#0,"""And one such large fluctuation<br>was predicted to occur 500 years later."""
ssc_504060_0320#0,"""This would corresponds with our<br>current encounter with the Starless."""
ssc_504060_0330#0,"""Although, the exact causal relationship between the<br>two encounters isn't precisely understood."""
ssc_504060_0340#0,"""At least, not by the Lecielans."""
ssc_504060_0350#0,"""Can you tell us anything else about Zephetto?"""
ssc_504060_0360#0,"""Can you tell us anything else about Resurgent ARKS?"""
ssc_504060_0370#0,"""...I've told you all that I know."""
ssc_504060_0380#0,"""We've never harbored much interest<br>or doubt in these sorts of things."""
ssc_504060_0390#0,"""Perhaps Zephetto intentionally didn't tell you more..."""
ssc_504060_0400#0,"""Or perhaps, he may have hid the whole story from you."""
ssc_504060_0410#0,"""Perhaps Leciel's interior holds the answers we seek..."""
ssc_504060_0420#0,"""..."""
ssc_504060_0430#0,"""Faria, can I count on you to continue<br>helping with our investigation?"""
ssc_504060_0440#0,"""Yes."""
