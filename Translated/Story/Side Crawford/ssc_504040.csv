ssc_504040_0020#0,"""We've just recently finished<br>integrating the Central Cannon."""
ssc_504040_0030#0,"""Thanks to the data sent over by Ilma, we were able to<br>identify all of our technological shortcomings."""
ssc_504040_0040#0,"""And none of this would've<br>happened without you three."""
ssc_504040_0050#0,"""Thank you, truly."""
ssc_504040_0060#0,"""We all worked hard for this."""
ssc_504040_0070#0,"""Ilma must be brilliant."""
ssc_504040_0080#0,"""We sure did."""
ssc_504040_0090#0,"""I heard how you, the girls, and<br>the five siblings all worked together."""
ssc_504040_0100#0,"""He really is."""
ssc_504040_0110#0,"""He can look at something from so many different<br>perspectives that I lack. He's a brilliant engineer."""
ssc_504040_0120#0,"""Have I mentioned how we met?<br>It's a funny story."""
ssc_504040_0130#0,"""One day, an anonymous comment was left<br>on a library of data I had gathered."""
ssc_504040_0140#0,"""When I opened it, I was greeted by a wall of text<br>which listed off every single inaccuracy in my data in exquisite detail."""
ssc_504040_0150#0,"""I thought to myself, \""There's no way.\""<br>So I looked into it, and sure enough, it was exactly as he said."""
ssc_504040_0160#0,"""Wondering who in the world this could have<br>been, I looked up the address and saw..."""
ssc_504040_0170#0,"""Origin: Kvaris."""
ssc_504040_0180#0,"""If this was true, there's only one<br>person who came to mind."""
ssc_504040_0190#0,"""But I knew that Rysas, the person with whom<br>I last interacted, had passed away, so I was taken aback..."""
ssc_504040_0200#0,"""And when I contacted the lodge, I received a reply from Ilma."""
ssc_504040_0210#0,"""After talking with him, I learned that his<br>machine tinkering was apparently self-taught."""
ssc_504040_0220#0,"""His approach disregarded established theory.<br>It was a fresh perspective to me."""
ssc_504040_0230#0,"""Ever since, he's been<br>someone I often go to for advice."""
ssc_504040_0240#0,"""As I did regarding<br>the Central Cannon."""
ssc_504040_0250#0,"""Nowadays, he's apparently been combing through<br>a vast wealth of documents left behind by Rysas."""
ssc_504040_0260#0,"""That level of ingenuity, furnished with<br>the theories of Rysas? I'll hardly stand a chance."""
ssc_504040_0270#0,"""So I'll just have to be<br>at the top of my game."""
ssc_504040_0280#0,"""...Such being the case, I'm going to keep pursuing<br>further improvements to the Central Cannon."""
ssc_504040_0290#0,"""To make sure we're totally<br>prepared for the next battle, of course."""
