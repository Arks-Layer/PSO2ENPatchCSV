ssc_504050_0010#0,"""Hm?"""
ssc_504050_0020#0,"""Ah, hey there. I was hoping you'd stop by."""
ssc_504050_0030#0,"""Do you have a moment to talk?"""
ssc_504050_0040#0,"""I was just asking Faria what she knows about the Starless."""
ssc_504050_0050#0,"""My knowledge may be somewhat limited."""
ssc_504050_0060#0,"""Even the smallest information would be<br>monumental for us right now."""
ssc_504050_0070#0,"""As you're the Guardian, I thought it'd be good<br>to share this information with you as well."""
ssc_504050_0080#0,"""With that in mind, do you have anything<br>you'd like to ask her about the Starless?"""
ssc_504050_0090#0,"""When did they first appear?"""
ssc_504050_0100#0,"""Where did they come from?"""
ssc_504050_0110#0,"""The Starless first appeared roughly 500 years ago."""
ssc_504050_0120#0,"""They appeared from beyond the sphere of our existence and immediately carried out a one-sided assault."""
ssc_504050_0130#0,"""The Starless suddenly appeared from a<br>place beyond the sphere of our existence."""
ssc_504050_0140#0,"""Then, they carried out a one-sided assault on humanity."""
ssc_504050_0150#0,"""Unfortunately, the people of that time stood little chance and,<br>as a result, the outer edges of our sphere of existence..."""
ssc_504050_0160#0,"""In other words, the remote star systems,<br>were robbed of countless lives."""
ssc_504050_0170#0,"""They only attacked remote star systems?"""
ssc_504050_0180#0,"""Were the other star systems able to fight them off?"""
ssc_504050_0190#0,"""It would seem so, yes."""
ssc_504050_0200#0,"""So it would seem."""
ssc_504050_0210#0,"""Very few attacks were made on the other star systems.<br>So they weren't exactly \""repelled\"", so to speak."""
ssc_504050_0220#0,"""After the Starless had destroyed the remote star systems,<br>they appeared to set their sights on bordering systems, but..."""
ssc_504050_0230#0,"""After a time, they suddenly disappeared."""
ssc_504050_0240#0,"""Were they hiding somewhere?"""
ssc_504050_0250#0,"""They retreated?"""
ssc_504050_0260#0,"""Aye."""
ssc_504050_0270#0,"""The people of that time seemed to think the same thing.<br>Apparently, they carried out a large-scale search effort to find them."""
ssc_504050_0280#0,"""However, no matter how hard they looked,<br>they couldn't find a single trace of them...."""
ssc_504050_0290#0,"""Correct. Hiding is one thing, but they<br>couldn't even find signs of an evacuation."""
ssc_504050_0300#0,"""Perhaps something happened on their end<br>which caused them to retreat."""
ssc_504050_0310#0,"""...Or so the people of the time thought, but..."""
ssc_504050_0320#0,"""In the following investigations, they were<br>unable to find any signs of a sudden retreat."""
ssc_504050_0330#0,"""They were also unable to find anything that<br>would suggest they went into hiding."""
ssc_504050_0340#0,"""Either way you look at it,<br>the Starless just suddenly vanished."""
ssc_504050_0350#0,"""That being said, it doesn't change the fact that<br>countless lives were lost in their relentless onslaught."""
ssc_504050_0360#0,"""Cognizant of this very real threat, there<br>were those who decided to take action."""
ssc_504050_0370#0,"""And so, Resurgent ARKS was formed."""
ssc_504050_0380#0,"""...Ah, but before we continue,<br>let's take a break for now."""
ssc_504050_0390#0,"""Return when you're ready,<br>and we'll continue."""
