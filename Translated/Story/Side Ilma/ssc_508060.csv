ssc_508060_0020#0,"""Taking a break?"""
ssc_508060_0030#0,"""Leciel..."""
ssc_508060_0040#0,"""Yeah, something like that.<br>We just happened to run into each other."""
ssc_508060_0050#0,"""We were just talking about that."""
ssc_508060_0060#0,"""Our investigation is making progress, little by little.<br>We've learned a lot about Leciel."""
ssc_508060_0070#0,"""Yeah. Our investigation is proceeding little by little."""
ssc_508060_0080#0,"""We were just talking about that."""
ssc_508060_0090#0,"""Care to join the discussion?"""
ssc_508060_0100#0,"""Faria mentioned it earlier, didn't she?<br>How Leciel's the control unit for all of Halpha."""
ssc_508060_0110#0,"""For example, it controls the weather and stuff like that."""
ssc_508060_0120#0,"""Wind, rain, snow..."""
ssc_508060_0130#0,"""All of it, artificially micromanaged by Leciel."""
ssc_508060_0140#0,"""Right down to the<br>temperature and humidity."""
ssc_508060_0150#0,"""To think anything could even be<br>capable of controlling all of that at once..."""
ssc_508060_0160#0,"""It's unbelievable."""
ssc_508060_0170#0,"""I had a feeling that was the case."""
ssc_508060_0180#0,"""Right?"""
ssc_508060_0190#0,"""I'm astonished as well."""
ssc_508060_0200#0,"""Wait, really?"""
ssc_508060_0210#0,"""That's some power of deduction you have.<br>You'd make a good researcher."""
ssc_508060_0220#0,"""Oh, we also got some new<br>information from the Lecielans."""
ssc_508060_0230#0,"""In the inner portion of Leciel, there was<br>an area that only Zephetto could enter."""
ssc_508060_0240#0,"""If we go there ourselves, we could learn things<br>that even the Lecielans weren't privy to."""
ssc_508060_0250#0,"""Like information regarding the Starless."""
ssc_508060_0260#0,"""I see... Is there no way<br>to access the area directly?"""
ssc_508060_0270#0,"""Unfortunately, no..."""
ssc_508060_0280#0,"""The teleporter that was<br>used earlier still doesn't work."""
ssc_508060_0290#0,"""But we think we've found another<br>route of access to Leciel's interior."""
ssc_508060_0300#0,"""Huh..."""
ssc_508060_0310#0,"""A scouting party's already in the works.<br>I've actually checked it out myself."""
ssc_508060_0320#0,"""But..."""
ssc_508060_0330#0,"""On the way there, there's this kind of...<br>I don't know, different dimension?"""
ssc_508060_0340#0,"""A different dimension...?"""
ssc_508060_0350#0,"""Yeah. We don't have much<br>to go on at the moment, but..."""
ssc_508060_0360#0,"""From what we can tell, it was used as a testing<br>site from before they started working on Halpha."""
ssc_508060_0370#0,"""It's that sort of site, or<br>at least the remnants of one."""
ssc_508060_0380#0,"""...And it's a pretty nasty place.<br>There were enemies everywhere."""
ssc_508060_0390#0,"""I get the feeling it's not going to be<br>easy to get into the central region."""
ssc_508060_0400#0,"""For now, we're going to investigate that place,<br>and then plan forward from there."""
ssc_508060_0410#0,"""I see. Thanks for the information."""
ssc_508060_0420#0,"""Well, if anything else<br>comes up, I'll let you know."""
