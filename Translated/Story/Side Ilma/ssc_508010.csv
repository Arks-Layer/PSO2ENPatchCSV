ssc_508010_0010#0,"""...Huh? Well if it isn't <%me>."""
ssc_508010_0020#0,"""What're you doing<br>all the way out here?"""
ssc_508010_0030#0,"""I'd ask you the same."""
ssc_508010_0040#0,"""I was heading for Lost Central."""
ssc_508010_0050#0,"""I'm doing some investigation<br>for my research."""
ssc_508010_0060#0,"""Oh, don't worry.<br>I wasn't going to Lost Central or anything."""
ssc_508010_0070#0,"""Ah, I see."""
ssc_508010_0080#0,"""I was just gathering some samples<br>in this area for my research."""
ssc_508010_0090#0,"""Though I do want to continue<br>investigating Lost Central."""
ssc_508010_0100#0,"""Meri and them kept saying<br>\""Don't you dare go in alone!\""."""
ssc_508010_0110#0,"""So, hey..."""
ssc_508010_0120#0,"""I just want to say...<br>Thanks for saving me back then."""
ssc_508010_0130#0,"""Amidst all the commotion,<br>I don't think I ever properly thanked you."""
ssc_508010_0140#0,"""Back then, I didn't think it would<br>become that big of an ordeal outside."""
ssc_508010_0150#0,"""Though communication was being jammed,<br>and there were a bunch of DOLLS nearby."""
ssc_508010_0160#0,"""I had prepared enough food, and there was<br>a mountain of data I wanted to look at."""
ssc_508010_0170#0,"""After being there a while, I figured<br>I'd just sneak out of there when I had the chance."""
ssc_508010_0180#0,"""I... guess I should've left someone a<br>message before I left, so that was my bad."""
ssc_508010_0190#0,"""When I was reading my Grandpa's reports in the lodge's study..."""
ssc_508010_0200#0,"""I found some documents<br>regarding the Central Cannon."""
ssc_508010_0210#0,"""I thought \""This is amazing!\"", and before I knew it,<br>I was already headed to Lost Central."""
ssc_508010_0220#0,"""Once I get started on something, I have this<br>really bad habit of tunnel-vision."""
ssc_508010_0230#0,"""I've been trying to work on it."""
ssc_508010_0240#0,"""...But hey, I did manage to<br>improve the Central Cannon, right?"""
ssc_508010_0250#0,"""I could probably resume investigation into Lost Central...<br>Former Central City, and all that..."""
ssc_508010_0260#0,"""I think there could be some merit to it...<br>What do you say?"""
ssc_508010_0270#0,"""You've done more than enough."""
ssc_508010_0280#0,"""Absolutely not."""
ssc_508010_0290#0,"""Y-Yeah, I guess you're right."""
ssc_508010_0300#0,"""Ughhh, Meri would NOT let me hear the end of it, though..."""
ssc_508010_0310#0,"""A-Ah...<br>You too, huh?"""
ssc_508010_0320#0,"""You know, when we got back to the lodge that day,<br>Meri really wouldn't let me hear the end of it..."""
ssc_508010_0330#0,"""Well, let's just say I always make sure to<br>tell someone when I'm heading out somewhere."""
ssc_508010_0340#0,"""And when I'm gonna be late coming back,<br>I call ahead of time to let someone know."""
ssc_508010_0350#0,"""If possible, I also try not to<br>do everything by myself."""
ssc_508010_0360#0,"""I wasn't the only one who was like that, though.<br>Before, we all just kind of did our own thing."""
ssc_508010_0370#0,"""Lately though, I've noticed everyone's been<br>communicating and doing stuff together."""
ssc_508010_0380#0,"""It feels like, ever since that incident,<br>we've all changed quite a bit."""
ssc_508010_0390#0,"""Anyways, that's not the point!"""
ssc_508010_0400#0,"""From now on, I'll be contributing to<br>Aelio's efforts more than ever."""
ssc_508010_0410#0,"""I'll be helping with the Central Cannon,<br>and supporting various other projects."""
ssc_508010_0420#0,"""That's an endeavor that<br>I'm certain holds real merit."""
ssc_508010_0430#0,"""So, to reiterate..."""
ssc_508010_0440#0,"""Let's both do our best."""
