ssc_508030_0010#0,"""Whoa... Oh, it's you."""
ssc_508030_0020#0,"""I thought you were<br>an enemy for a moment."""
ssc_508030_0030#0,"""I always have to get Taivas and them<br>to bail me out in those situations."""
ssc_508030_0040#0,"""They're all so great at fighting, and then there's me,<br>far too preoccupied with fancy Ores."""
ssc_508030_0050#0,"""...But hey, enough about that."""
ssc_508030_0060#0,"""Did you find something here?"""
ssc_508030_0070#0,"""Still investigating?"""
ssc_508030_0080#0,"""Nothing in particular, no."""
ssc_508030_0090#0,"""I'm just enjoying the view."""
ssc_508030_0100#0,"""No, today I'm doing<br>something else for a change."""
ssc_508030_0110#0,"""It dulls the mind to be holed up<br>indoors all day, after all."""
ssc_508030_0120#0,"""I've been thinking about the<br>Central Cannon quite a lot lately."""
ssc_508030_0130#0,"""Aelio's Central Cannon adjustments were largely<br>based on data from Lost Central's Cannon."""
ssc_508030_0140#0,"""The two Cannons share a lot of similarities."""
ssc_508030_0150#0,"""They have the same number of Photon generators, their<br>capacitor units can hold a similar amount of Photons..."""
ssc_508030_0160#0,"""Their specs differ quite a bit, but<br>they were built on nearly the same foundations."""
ssc_508030_0170#0,"""Therefore, the Aelio Cannon's problems were almost<br>entirely solved by inspecting Lost Central's Cannon."""
ssc_508030_0180#0,"""...That is to say, in other words..."""
ssc_508030_0190#0,"""There was likely some sort of plan to mass-produce<br>Cannons like the one found in Central City."""
ssc_508030_0200#0,"""Both Lost Central and Central City themselves<br>are incredibly similar to begin with."""
ssc_508030_0210#0,"""Not just in appearance,<br>but also in city structure."""
ssc_508030_0220#0,"""Central City was modeled after Lost Central."""
ssc_508030_0230#0,"""So obviously it would be similar, but \""we\"" weren't the ones who designed it."""
ssc_508030_0240#0,"""Central's City's infrastructure was merely recycled from<br>something that was always there to begin with."""
ssc_508030_0250#0,"""\""Someone\"" had already made the blueprint. It was just<br>a matter of gathering the materials and building the city."""
ssc_508030_0260#0,"""...You know, just the other day, a huge<br>container was found underneath Retem City."""
ssc_508030_0270#0,"""Inside that container were<br>parts for a Central Cannon."""
ssc_508030_0280#0,"""Again, almost identical in make and model<br>to the Cannons in Aelio and Kvaris."""
ssc_508030_0290#0,"""Retem City might look the way it does now..."""
ssc_508030_0300#0,"""But perhaps they had plans to<br>build it into yet another Central City."""
ssc_508030_0310#0,"""Build? Who are \""they?\"""""
ssc_508030_0320#0,"""Retem's ancestors did?"""
ssc_508030_0330#0,"""...Uh, that... certainly is the question."""
ssc_508030_0340#0,"""No, I don't believe so."""
ssc_508030_0350#0,"""\""Someone\"" different from the<br>people that live on Halpha today."""
ssc_508030_0360#0,"""Beings that once lived on Halpha, but disappeared<br>all of a sudden, leaving their grand structures behind..."""
ssc_508030_0370#0,"""We've always thought they existed, but until recently<br>we haven't been able to fill in any of the blanks."""
ssc_508030_0380#0,"""This recent discovery may finally allow us to truly<br>shed some light on exactly \""who\"" these beings were."""
ssc_508030_0390#0,"""What were they trying to do<br>all those years ago?"""
ssc_508030_0400#0,"""What else was there,<br>all those years ago?"""
ssc_508030_0410#0,"""I think we're going to have to learn<br>the answers to these questions soon."""
ssc_508030_0420#0,"""Perhaps in the near future we may encounter<br>a threat even greater than Dark Falz."""
ssc_508030_0430#0,"""If we're going to prepare for every possibility,<br>we have to learn as much as we can..."""
ssc_508030_0440#0,"""So that's why..."""
ssc_508030_0450#0,"""...Aah, sorry, sorry. I went off<br>on another tangent."""
ssc_508030_0460#0,"""When I get a better grasp on all of this,<br>I'll explain it in a much more organized manner."""
ssc_508030_0470#0,"""Phew... First, we're going to<br>have to find even more clues."""
ssc_508030_0480#0,"""I'll contact Crawford and his researchers<br>to see if we can exchange some info."""
ssc_508030_0490#0,"""And with Retem as well, if possible."""
ssc_508030_0500#0,"""Huh. For some reason, I can always<br>sort out my thoughts after talking to you."""
ssc_508030_0510#0,"""Thanks for chatting with me."""
ssc_508030_0520#0,"""I'm going to head back to the lodge<br>and start writing."""
ssc_508030_0530#0,"""Seeya."""
