ssc_508020_0010#0,"""Mmm? Ah, hey there."""
ssc_508020_0020#0,"""I'm doing a small favor for Crawford."""
ssc_508020_0030#0,"""...Oh, yeah.<br>Do you have a moment?"""
ssc_508020_0040#0,"""As a topic of conversation, I wanted to talk to you<br>about Crawford and I."""
ssc_508020_0050#0,"""I'm interested."""
ssc_508020_0060#0,"""Any juicy secrets?"""
ssc_508020_0070#0,"""Alright, then."""
ssc_508020_0080#0,"""Nah, nothing big like that."""
ssc_508020_0090#0,"""As you know, my siblings and I have<br>lived in Kvaris for our WHOLE lives."""
ssc_508020_0100#0,"""The only people we ever really<br>interacted with regularly were family."""
ssc_508020_0110#0,"""Occasionally, some ARKS from Aelio might stop by, but..."""
ssc_508020_0120#0,"""It was usually just to ask for<br>directions or information."""
ssc_508020_0130#0,"""Other than that, it's just been us<br>and this pure white land."""
ssc_508020_0140#0,"""While my siblings were spurred on by the<br>\""Restoration of Kvaris\"" that Grandpa dreamed of..."""
ssc_508020_0150#0,"""For me, it felt like there was<br>something missing from that sort of daily routine."""
ssc_508020_0160#0,"""Then, one day, while I was organizing some data on my terminal,<br>I found a forum with all kinds of research data."""
ssc_508020_0170#0,"""In it, certain entries<br>happened to catch my eye."""
ssc_508020_0180#0,"""Later I would learn that<br>these entries were written by Crawford."""
ssc_508020_0190#0,"""Without knowing why, I listed all of<br>his errors in a comment under his work..."""
ssc_508020_0200#0,"""Shortly after, I received a huge series of<br>questions in one extremely long reply."""
ssc_508020_0210#0,"""That was my first meeting with Crawford."""
ssc_508020_0220#0,"""Well, I guess I didn't really meet him,<br>since everything was in text."""
ssc_508020_0230#0,"""So, when did you meet in person?"""
ssc_508020_0240#0,"""Wait, you've never actually seen his face?"""
ssc_508020_0250#0,"""We haven't. Honestly, I can't even<br>remember what he looks like."""
ssc_508020_0260#0,"""I doubt Crawford knows<br>what I look like either."""
ssc_508020_0270#0,"""Well, I mean, obviously I've..."""
ssc_508020_0280#0,"""Huh. I can't seem to<br>remember what he looks like..."""
ssc_508020_0290#0,"""Ah, but, we have sent<br>our photos before."""
ssc_508020_0300#0,"""Like the one I just sent recently."""
ssc_508020_0310#0,"""I heard that's what you used<br>to help look for me."""
ssc_508020_0320#0,"""You look quite different in person."""
ssc_508020_0330#0,"""We kept mistaking your siblings for you."""
ssc_508020_0340#0,"""Oh? I do?"""
ssc_508020_0350#0,"""Ah, did you keep mistaking<br>my siblings for me?"""
ssc_508020_0360#0,"""We do have similar features..."""
ssc_508020_0370#0,"""If not for our clothes and hair color,<br>we might be hard to tell apart."""
ssc_508020_0380#0,"""Ahh, yeah, I guess that would've<br>made the search rather difficult."""
ssc_508020_0390#0,"""We do have similar features, after all..."""
ssc_508020_0400#0,"""If not for our clothes and hair color,<br>we might be hard to tell apart."""
ssc_508020_0410#0,"""Well anyways, getting back on topic..."""
ssc_508020_0420#0,"""Even without seeing his face, the contents of his reports gave<br>a general idea of how he was feeling."""
ssc_508020_0430#0,"""Like, I could feel how passionate he was about it,<br>and how hard he had been working towards certain goals."""
ssc_508020_0440#0,"""We can just understand each other without<br>seeing or speaking to each other directly."""
ssc_508020_0450#0,"""Even now, during technical discussions,<br>there's a lot of us just writing back and forth."""
ssc_508020_0460#0,"""In that way, Crawford and I continue to build<br>a healthy relationship, as both friends and fellow researchers."""
ssc_508020_0470#0,"""Lately, I've gotten the opportunity to work with other researchers,<br>but none have been as quick and accurate as Crawford."""
ssc_508020_0480#0,"""All over again, I find myself realizing<br>\""Wow, he's an amazing person\""..."""
ssc_508020_0490#0,"""Ah, but don't tell him I said that.<br>It might go to his head."""
ssc_508020_0500#0,"""Anyways, that's enough<br>about Crawford and I."""
ssc_508020_0510#0,"""Most people would probably think<br>it's a weird sort of friendship, but hey."""
ssc_508020_0520#0,"""I just wanted to<br>let you know a bit about it."""
ssc_508020_0530#0,"""I'll see you later."""
