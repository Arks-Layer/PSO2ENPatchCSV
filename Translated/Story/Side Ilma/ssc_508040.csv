ssc_508040_0010#0,"""...Phew."""
ssc_508040_0020#0,"""What are you doing out here?"""
ssc_508040_0030#0,"""What are we investigating today?"""
ssc_508040_0040#0,"""Hm?"""
ssc_508040_0050#0,"""Oh, it's you."""
ssc_508040_0060#0,"""Hm?"""
ssc_508040_0070#0,"""Oh, it's you. What am I investigating?"""
ssc_508040_0080#0,"""I'm reviewing the condition of the Environmental Control Units."""
ssc_508040_0090#0,"""Environmental Control Units?"""
ssc_508040_0100#0,"""...?"""
ssc_508040_0110#0,"""Yeah, you know..."""
ssc_508040_0120#0,"""Oh, sorry."""
ssc_508040_0130#0,"""Those giant devices over there<br>that line the borders of every region."""
ssc_508040_0140#0,"""Those things apparently manage Halpha's environments."""
ssc_508040_0150#0,"""Though we've always kind of assumed that's what they did."""
ssc_508040_0160#0,"""But thanks to information provided by the Lecielans,<br>we now know more details about them."""
ssc_508040_0170#0,"""Apparently, there are similar devices<br>placed way out in the open sea."""
ssc_508040_0180#0,"""I haven't seen anything like that."""
ssc_508040_0190#0,"""So we can't go beyond the ocean?"""
ssc_508040_0200#0,"""Well, I doubt you would have."""
ssc_508040_0210#0,"""Yeah. It seems that way..."""
ssc_508040_0220#0,"""This whole island's environment is being managed entirely through Leciel."""
ssc_508040_0230#0,"""Beyond the island, the atmospheric composition isn't suitable for us to breathe."""
ssc_508040_0240#0,"""And so, we can't leave this place."""
ssc_508040_0250#0,"""Oh, by the way, \""island\"" is the word for the ground we're all currently standing on."""
ssc_508040_0260#0,"""The Lecielans have been calling it things like<br>\""Halpha Island\"" and \""Central Island\""."""
ssc_508040_0270#0,"""...And, given the context, well..."""
ssc_508040_0280#0,"""It would seem there are many islands similar to this one<br>that have been developed by Resurgent ARKS."""
ssc_508040_0290#0,"""The majority of which were considered<br>unusable and were abandoned."""
ssc_508040_0300#0,"""Some of these experimental islands<br>were discovered not too long ago."""
ssc_508040_0310#0,"""I think they're being called<br>\""Creative Spaces\"" or something."""
ssc_508040_0320#0,"""Many of those islands can be reached by way of Ryuker Device."""
ssc_508040_0330#0,"""Well, assuming you have the right destination address."""
ssc_508040_0340#0,"""Have you tried visiting one of those islands yet?"""
ssc_508040_0350#0,"""I have."""
ssc_508040_0360#0,"""Not yet."""
ssc_508040_0370#0,"""I see."""
ssc_508040_0380#0,"""Well if you do, I'd be interested in any creations you make."""
ssc_508040_0390#0,"""If you complete any creations there, I hope you'll let me see them."""
