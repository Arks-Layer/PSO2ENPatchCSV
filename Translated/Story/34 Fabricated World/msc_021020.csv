msc_021020_0050#0,"""What could drive someone<br>to do something like that?!"""

msc_021020_0100#0,"""Apparently, they're a threat to all mankind.<br>Said to have killed 700 billion people 500 years ago..."""

msc_021020_0140#0,"""Right. I want to have a constructive discussion<br>about this under the assumption it's all true."""
msc_021020_0150#0,"""Going on that, let's start with how much of a threat these Starless pose to us."""
msc_021020_0160#0,"""Have any of you encountered the Starless?"""
msc_021020_0170#0,"""We only saw them on a monitor."""
msc_021020_0180#0,"""We haven't actually fought them, no."""
msc_021020_0190#0,"""Right. All of a sudden, a huge number of them appeared,<br>and then Zephetto went to confront them..."""
msc_021020_0200#0,"""As for what happened afterwards... we don't know."""
msc_021020_0210#0,"""If Zephetto created the DOLLS<br>as a means of strengthening the ARKS..."""
msc_021020_0220#0,"""...then we should assume that they<br>pose an even greater threat than Dark Falz..."""
msc_021020_0230#0,"""That being said, we don't know<br>when exactly the Starless will attack."""
msc_021020_0240#0,"""It could be tomorrow. It could be<br>several hundred years from now."""

msc_021020_0320#0,"""Oh, I know. Maybe Leciel has some<br>clues about how to stop them...?"""
msc_021020_0330#0,"""Right. At around the same time you three made your escape,<br>the Resurgent ARKS aboard Leciel also fled the structure."""
msc_021020_0340#0,"""According to some of their testimony, there exists a device<br>to control the DOLLS somewhere in Leciel's central region."""

msc_021020_0390#0,"""Perhaps it was damaged in a Starless attack,<br>or perhaps Zephetto did something to it beforehand..."""

msc_021020_0500#0,"""You got it."""
msc_021020_0510#0,"""There simply must be other avenues open to us.<br>Methods of travel to Leciel, methods of stopping the DOLLS..."""

msc_021020_0530#0,"""That's true. The Ryuker Devices, Trinitas..."""
msc_021020_0540#0,"""We should now be able to learn<br>even more about them, don't you think?"""
msc_021020_0550#0,"""With the cooperation of<br>members of Resurgent ARKS, surely."""
msc_021020_0560#0,"""What about the DOLLS Manufacturing Facility in Stia？"""
msc_021020_0570#0,"""Can't we at least shut that place down?"""
msc_021020_0580#0,"""We'll be looking into that place again as well. If push comes to shove,<br>we may have to take the risk and simply destroy the place."""
