msc_014380_0010#0,"""Crawford, what just happened?<br>Did Dark Falz manage to run away again?"""
msc_014380_0020#0,"""Everything will be<br>alright. Stay calm."""
msc_014380_0030#0,"""Let me start from<br>the beginning."""
msc_014380_0040#0,"""First, we can all assume Dark Falz fled into<br>a separate dimension, as he once did previously."""
msc_014380_0050#0,"""However, he is<br>now wounded."""
msc_014380_0060#0,"""He appears to have some degree of regenerative abilities, but he can't<br>fully heal without that docking bay in Stia's central region."""
msc_014380_0070#0,"""So eventually he will have to<br>reappear in this dimension."""
msc_014380_0080#0,"""How do you know all this?"""
msc_014380_0090#0,"""From Rysas' documents."""
msc_014380_0100#0,"""That, as well as some data<br>assembled by Ilma and I."""
msc_014380_0110#0,"""Rysas kept painstakingly thorough records of the battle with Dark Falz<br>that took place in Kvaris a hundred years ago."""
msc_014380_0120#0,"""He was incredibly thorough and descriptive.<br>Going through his records was like being there in person."""
msc_014380_0130#0,"""He wrote about Dark Falz's behavioral<br>patterns, and the times he was active."""
msc_014380_0140#0,"""The Kvarisian ARKS back then had put<br>up quite a good fight against Dark Falz."""
msc_014380_0150#0,"""He wrote how, after receiving critical damage due to concentrated fire,<br>Dark Falz would take refuge \""somewhere\"" and wouldn't return for a while."""
msc_014380_0160#0,"""And, when he returned some time later,<br>all the areas that were damaged were healed."""
msc_014380_0170#0,"""That \""somewhere\"" turned out to be<br>that place in Stia."""
msc_014380_0180#0,"""So there was that much information in Rysas' documents..."""
msc_014380_0190#0,"""Yeah. I didn't believe it myself until I<br>actually saw the central region of Stia."""
msc_014380_0200#0,"""...Nevertheless."""
msc_014380_0210#0,"""We've always thought that Dark Falz and<br>the DOLLS came from the \""outside\""..."""
msc_014380_0220#0,"""But now we find a structure of that scale<br>and complexity within our very own Halpha."""
msc_014380_0230#0,"""One can't help but wonder when all of<br>that was made... and who made it."""
msc_014380_0240#0,"""...Well, let's set speculation<br>aside for now."""
msc_014380_0250#0,"""Our next course of action is simple."""
msc_014380_0260#0,"""We use the completed Central Cannon to fire<br>a second volley at Dark Falz as he reappears."""
msc_014380_0270#0,"""We've nearly completed analysis on his Photon spectra.<br>We'll be able to tell when and where he'll reappear."""
msc_014380_0280#0,"""Even if he does escape again, we'll<br>know where his destination is."""
msc_014380_0290#0,"""We'll keep attacking like this, whittling<br>him down piece by piece if we have to."""
msc_014380_0300#0,"""Even if it takes time, all that matters<br>is that we win this in the end..."""
msc_014380_0305#0,"""...It's just, there's one small problem."""
msc_014380_0310#0,"""We don't actually know if this Dark Falz and the<br>Dark Falz in Rysas' records are one and the same entity."""
msc_014380_0320#0,"""If they are completely different beings entirely, this<br>one could be capable of things not recorded in the data."""
msc_014380_0330#0,"""Rather, I should say he most likely will be."""
msc_014380_0340#0,"""This is Dark Falz we're dealing with, after all."""
msc_014380_0350#0,"""We have several back-up plans being arranged for, but<br>how useful they'll be will depend on the situation..."""
msc_014380_0360#0,"""In that case..."""
msc_014380_0370#0,"""Our hope will rest on the strength<br>of each and every member of ARKS."""
msc_014380_0380#0,"""As for when he reappears..."""
msc_014380_0390#0,"""<%me>, just as before, I'd like you<br>to be on the front lines."""
msc_014380_0400#0,"""What about us?"""
msc_014380_0410#0,"""I have plans for you as well."""
msc_014380_0420#0,"""I'll contact you about that later, I just<br>need some time to finalize things."""
msc_014380_0430#0,"""Yup, understood."""
msc_014380_0440#0,"""Thank you for allowing me to<br>impose upon you all for just a bit longer."""
msc_014380_0450#0,"""Don't worry about it.<br>We'll get through this one way or another!"""
msc_014380_0460#0,"""That's how we've always done things anyways."""
msc_014380_0470#0,"""Right?"""
