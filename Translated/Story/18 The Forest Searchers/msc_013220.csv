msc_013220_0020#0,"""Are you... sure it's safe to go this deep into the forest all alone?"""
msc_013220_0030#0,"""Course I am. Out of all us siblings, I'm the most familiar with the Kvaris Region."""
msc_013220_0040#0,"""But you still ended up surrounded by DOLLS."""
msc_013220_0050#0,"""Hahaha, what's adventure without a few dangers here and there?"""
msc_013220_0060#0,"""But I guess I could have handled things better. I'll be more vigilant from here on!"""
msc_013220_0070#0,"""We met with Tulli, but he hadn't found any sign of Ilma. Did you have any luck?"""
msc_013220_0080#0,"""I'm afraid I've found just as little."""
msc_013220_0090#0,"""I even checked up and down every tree. Where the heck could the little guy have gone...?"""
msc_013220_0100#0,"""Is there anywhere else left to look?"""
msc_013220_0110#0,"""Only place left is Lost Central..."""
msc_013220_0120#0,"""Lost Central... The city that was encased in ice during the battle with Dark Falz..."""
msc_013220_0130#0,"""Yeah, but there's no way to get in."""
msc_013220_0140#0,"""The DOLLS surrounding it are incredibly tough, you can't even get close."""
msc_013220_0150#0,"""I have a hard time imagining Ilma would go there."""
msc_013220_0160#0,"""Which means..."""
msc_013220_0170#0,"""Hmm..."""
msc_013220_0180#0,"""We shouldn't remain out here for too long. Let's return to the lodge for now."""
msc_013220_0200#0,"""I'll go on ahead and wait there for you! Come join us after you take care of whatever other business you've got left!"""
