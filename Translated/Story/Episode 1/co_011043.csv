text04#0,"""Once you've learned the Partizan Gear skill, a gear gauge is added to the top of your weapon palette. The partizan gear gauge fills up as you perform graceful actions after an attack. You can also hold down <%WeaponAction> to perform these actions and fill up your gear gauge."""
text05#0,"""The gear gauge fills up to three bars, and each photon art you use consumes one bar. The gear gauge does not drop over time. Photon arts unleashed using the gear gauge have a wider attack radius and do more damage. The partizan gear system rewards your elegant maneuvers by enhancing your attacks."""
