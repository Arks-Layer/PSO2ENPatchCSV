text01#0,"""This will explain the Excube system.  This system allows even players who have reached the max level of their class to gain experience, and trade 1 level's worth of experience for a special item."""
text02#0,"""In order to use this system, the player must be at the max level for their class, so they must clear all the Client Orders from Koffie in the \""Level Cap Unlock Test\""  Afterwards, when defeating hostiles and when claiming Client Order rewards, players gain orange colored experience points, and when they collect 1 level's worth they will immediately receive multiple Excubes.  If the player cannot hold these Excubes at the time, they will be sent to storage or temporary storage."""
text03#0,"""When you have acquired enough Excubes, they can be exchanged for special items at the Excube exchange shop.  The Excube exchange shop is located on the 2nd floor of the Shop Area."""
