msc_023110_0010#0,"""Ah, <%me>, there you are."""
msc_023110_0020#0,"""I see Aina hasn't come here today."""
msc_023110_0030#0,"""What's this about Aina?"""
msc_023110_0040#0,"""Does Aina usually come here?"""
msc_023110_0050#0,"""She visits this place almost every day, you see."""
msc_023110_0060#0,"""Indeed. Almost every day, at that."""
msc_023110_0070#0,"""To ask me to teach her the \""secrets to being a leader\""."""
msc_023110_0080#0,"""It came as quite a shock to hear her<br>ask me such a thing out of the blue."""
msc_023110_0090#0,"""But alas... It's not something I can<br>really answer in my own words."""
msc_023110_0100#0,"""Most of what I know about being a leader<br>was taught to me by Hadi."""
msc_023110_0110#0,"""And so, when I called him over,<br>she bombarded him with questions."""
msc_023110_0120#0,"""Hadi, being the a natural teacher he is,<br>was delighted to see Aina's passion for learning."""
msc_023110_0130#0,"""The two of them spoke at length amongst themselves."""
msc_023110_0140#0,"""I believe they went somewhere for a lesson<br>on the use of terrain to gain an advantage in battle."""
msc_023110_0150#0,"""I must say, Aina's enthusiasm is quite contagious."""
msc_023110_0160#0,"""So that's what she's been up to."""
msc_023110_0170#0,"""She's been giving it her all, huh."""
msc_023110_0180#0,"""You say that as if you haven't asked her anything."""
msc_023110_0190#0,"""Indeed. Though she did seem to be<br>in a bit of a rush at times."""
msc_023110_0200#0,"""It seems we weren't the only ones she asked for an opinion."""
msc_023110_0210#0,"""She said she even went all the way to<br>ask Taivas and Guren, as well."""
msc_023110_0220#0,"""I didn't think Guren would be so open to<br>divulging his methods to someone else..."""
msc_023110_0230#0,"""But in a pleasant surprise, it seems<br>he taught her, and rather considerately at that."""
msc_023110_0240#0,"""Perhaps he's more kind-hearted than he lets on."""
msc_023110_0250#0,"""Or perhaps there's just something<br>about Aina that allows him to open up."""
msc_023110_0260#0,"""...So, is it true that Aina seeks to become a leader?"""
msc_023110_0270#0,"""For now, she just trains recruits."""
msc_023110_0280#0,"""That's up to her."""
msc_023110_0290#0,"""For now? So you also think she's<br>destined for greater heights, then?"""
msc_023110_0300#0,"""Hehehe... Indeed it is."""
msc_023110_0310#0,"""I look forward to seeing her growth in the coming days."""
