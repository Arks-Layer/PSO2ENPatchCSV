msc_020220_0030#0,"""Crawford brought me up to speed.<br>Sounds like things are getting pretty serious."""
msc_020220_0040#0,"""Is this the girl from the Floating Island? From Leciel?"""
msc_020220_0050#0,"""Faria."""
msc_020220_0060#0,"""Hey there, Faria.<br>My name is Ilma."""
msc_020220_0070#0,"""...Anyways, jumping right into things,<br>can you show us how to get into Leciel?"""
msc_020220_0080#0,"""Understood."""
msc_020220_0090#0,"""...It's not working."""
msc_020220_0100#0,"""What's wrong?"""
msc_020220_0110#0,"""Is there a problem?"""
msc_020220_0120#0,"""..."""
msc_020220_0130#0,"""Yes..."""
msc_020220_0140#0,"""The teleporter failed to start up.<br>It seems that it's been locked."""
msc_020220_0150#0,"""Looks like this<br>is where I come in."""
msc_020220_0160#0,"""...To think that Leciel serves as Halpha's controller unit..."""
msc_020220_0170#0,"""What's more, that it sent down DOLLS and<br>Meteorn to make them fight each other."""
msc_020220_0180#0,"""I have to admit, even I<br>didn't believe it at first."""
msc_020220_0190#0,"""..."""
msc_020220_0200#0,"""Hey, can we talk for a moment?"""
msc_020220_0210#0,"""Yes."""
msc_020220_0220#0,"""You kind of remind me how Manon was when she first arrived."""
msc_020220_0230#0,"""Is that so."""
msc_020220_0240#0,"""Yeah, like that. Your behavior.<br>Can I ask you a bit more about Manon?"""
msc_020220_0250#0,"""If it's within my ability to answer."""
msc_020220_0260#0,"""Yeah, that's fine."""
msc_020220_0270#0,"""How do you know Manon?"""
msc_020220_0280#0,"""I am Manon's backup."""
msc_020220_0290#0,"""I monitor her activity. Should a problem arise,<br>I provide her support."""
msc_020220_0300#0,"""So you've always been watching Manon? From Leciel?"""
msc_020220_0310#0,"""Yes."""
msc_020220_0320#0,"""So, when you encountered this problem..."""
msc_020220_0330#0,"""It wasn't something you could resolve from Leciel,<br>so you came to us for help?"""
msc_020220_0340#0,"""That's right."""
msc_020220_0350#0,"""I... I see."""
msc_020220_0360#0,"""...Ummm... So, next question."""
msc_020220_0370#0,"""What was Manon doing here on Halpha?"""
msc_020220_0380#0,"""Documenting the Third Project."""
msc_020220_0390#0,"""Manon's role was to document and record<br>the battles between ARKS and Dark Falz."""
msc_020220_0400#0,"""She documented... the battles...?"""
msc_020220_0410#0,"""Did Manon know everything?"""
msc_020220_0420#0,"""Did Manon orchestrate the battles?"""
msc_020220_0430#0,"""No. She was only told what she needed to know."""
msc_020220_0440#0,"""No. She watched them unfold and reported the outcome."""
msc_020220_0450#0,"""So she wasn't a leader of this project... just an observer?"""
msc_020220_0460#0,"""Yes."""
msc_020220_0470#0,"""Uh... meaning...?"""
msc_020220_0480#0,"""In other words, all she was supposed to do was watch the people of Halpha."""
msc_020220_0490#0,"""She could've kept her distance and blended in as just another Meteorn."""
msc_020220_0500#0,"""But this means, to my knowledge, Manon deliberately went<br>out of her way to become involved with us."""
msc_020220_0510#0,"""Perhaps she had a change of heart after arriving here?"""
msc_020220_0520#0,"""Manon..."""
msc_020220_0530#0,"""Why did Manon return to Leciel?"""
msc_020220_0540#0,"""Is there anyone else on Leciel?"""
msc_020220_0550#0,"""She intends to stop Zephetto."""
msc_020220_0560#0,"""...Zephetto is on Leciel."""
msc_020220_0570#0,"""Zephetto?"""
msc_020220_0580#0,"""The administrator for the experiment on Halpha.<br>The governor of Resurgent ARKS."""
msc_020220_0590#0,"""And this Zephetto is the one who started this \""experiment\""?"""
msc_020220_0600#0,"""According to the records, yes."""
msc_020220_0610#0,"""...I see."""
msc_020220_0620#0,"""Zephetto is the one who created us.<br>Like a... father or a mother."""
msc_020220_0630#0,"""A father... or a mother..."""
msc_020220_0640#0,"""That's quite the unconventional<br>sort of family."""
msc_020220_0650#0,"""If this Zephetto has<br>full authority over Leciel..."""
msc_020220_0660#0,"""Then if we can persuade him or otherwise disarm him,<br>then the war against the DOLLS will be over..."""
msc_020220_0670#0,"""When did this experiment start?"""
msc_020220_0680#0,"""According to the records, it started 300 years ago."""
msc_020220_0690#0,"""300 YEARS?!"""
msc_020220_0700#0,"""..."""
msc_020220_0710#0,"""Then... an uncountable amount of ARKS were<br>sacrificed, all for this experiment..."""
msc_020220_0720#0,"""..."""
msc_020220_0730#0,"""What was the definitive reason<br>Manon decided to confront Zephetto?"""
msc_020220_0740#0,"""...I'm not sure."""
msc_020220_0750#0,"""...Well, there is one thing..."""
msc_020220_0760#0,"""While I was monitoring Manon's data,<br>I could see feelings of intense anger."""
msc_020220_0770#0,"""Anger at Zephetto?"""
msc_020220_0780#0,"""Yes."""
msc_020220_0790#0,"""So Manon really does intend to<br>put an end to this by herself."""
msc_020220_0800#0,"""But that's just... too reckless..."""
msc_020220_0810#0,"""..."""
msc_020220_0820#0,"""Hm?"""
msc_020220_0830#0,"""Teleporter successfully activated."""
msc_020220_0840#0,"""So this is a teleporter?"""
msc_020220_0850#0,"""But isn't this one for short distances?"""
msc_020220_0860#0,"""It may look like one, but it's<br>actually a hundred times stronger."""
msc_020220_0870#0,"""Even without a stable Photon Field,<br>it's capable of extremely long distances."""
msc_020220_0880#0,"""Whoa."""
msc_020220_0890#0,"""Alright, let's call everyone and<br>board this so-called Leciel, shall we?"""
msc_020220_0900#0,"""Can you hear me?"""
msc_020220_0910#0,"""Ah, Crawford. Good timing."""
msc_020220_0920#0,"""We've just finished preparations<br>to head for Leciel, so--"""
msc_020220_0930#0,"""No, our foray into<br>Leciel will have to wait."""
msc_020220_0940#0,"""Did something happen?"""
msc_020220_0950#0,"""A grand offensive from the DOLLS.<br>They're raining down all over Halpha right now."""
msc_020220_0960#0,"""They're what?!"""
msc_020220_0970#0,"""I've heard nothing on my end... You're saying<br>they evaded my entire security network?"""
msc_020220_0980#0,"""It's true. Unbelievable."""
msc_020220_0990#0,"""I've sent word to Taivas. I'll send<br>whatever support we can spare."""
