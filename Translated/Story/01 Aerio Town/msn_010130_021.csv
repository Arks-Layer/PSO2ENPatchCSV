text020_A#0,"""I'm Fyne. I'm a combat instructor in this village. Nice to meet you!"""
text010#0,"""What do you think of this place? Good folks, the lot of 'em. You'll get settled in no time."""
text020#0,"""Speaking of which, lately there's been a lot of enemies creeping along our shoreline."""
text030#0,"""Thanks to them, we've been unable to get any fishing done!"""
text040#0,"""So I was thinking, if I make it into a training lesson, you think you could take care of them nasties for us?"""
