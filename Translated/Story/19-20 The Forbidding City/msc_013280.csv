msc_013280_0020#0,"""Huh? What are...?"""
msc_013280_0030#0,"""Ilma!"""
msc_013280_0032#0,"""Ilma!"""
msc_013280_0034#0,"""Ilma!"""
msc_013280_0036#0,"""Ilma!"""
msc_013280_0040#0,"""You all came here for me?"""
msc_013280_0050#0,"""What are you even doing here?"""
msc_013280_0060#0,"""We've been worried sick!"""
msc_013280_0070#0,"""I'm sorry. I found a lead on how to get inside Lost Central while looking through Grandpa's research..."""
msc_013280_0080#0,"""I only wanted to take a quick look around... But then some strong DOLLS blocked the exit."""
msc_013280_0090#0,"""There was too much interference to send any messages, so I was completely trapped in here."""
msc_013280_0100#0,"""Thank you for coming to rescue me."""
msc_013280_0110#0,"""You never change."""
msc_013280_0120#0,"""Honestly now... You're always getting lost in your studies."""
msc_013280_0130#0,"""He can't help himself..."""
msc_013280_0140#0,"""We were so worried. I'm glad you're alright."""
msc_013280_0150#0,"""Thank goodness..."""
msc_013280_0160#0,"""We never could have found Ilma without you guys!"""
msc_013280_0170#0,"""That's right, thank you so much."""
msc_013280_0180#0,"""Don't be silly. We all worked together!"""
msc_013280_0190#0,"""Ilma, we need your help."""
msc_013280_0200#0,"""And you are...?"""
msc_013280_0210#0,"""Crawford sent us here from Central City."""
msc_013280_0220#0,"""...Ahh."""
msc_013280_0230#0,"""The data for improving the Central Cannon."""
msc_013280_0240#0,"""We were able to confirm that the cannon is capable of damaging Dark Falz in the last battle."""
msc_013280_0250#0,"""But we also came to realize there were two fundamental issues we were facing."""
msc_013280_0260#0,"""First is the output. Although we inflicted some damage, it was not enough to destroy Dark Falz."""
msc_013280_0270#0,"""For this, we need a Photon accelerator that's capable of high efficiency Photon compression and discharge."""
msc_013280_0280#0,"""The other issue is durability. The cannon was damaged after firing it just once."""
msc_013280_0283#0,"""So we're in need of a proper barrel and a Photon accelerator, as well as materials to reinforce the frame of the firing mechanism."""
msc_013280_0286#0,"""As I told Crawford, by my estimations we could solve both problems if we were to make use of materials and technology from this place."""
msc_013280_0290#0,"""And that's where our problem now lies. There is a plethora of resources and knowledge waiting for us within these depths at this very moment!"""
msc_013280_0300#0,"""...Uhh."""
msc_013280_0310#0,"""Could you run that by us again, Ilma?"""
msc_013280_0320#0,"""Ah, in other words... They once repelled Dark Falz with the weapons here in Lost Central."""
msc_013280_0330#0,"""I found some of their tech, but I think there's something even better down there."""
msc_013280_0350#0,"""What...?"""
msc_013280_0360#0,"""You'll see when we go deeper. Come on, everyone!"""
