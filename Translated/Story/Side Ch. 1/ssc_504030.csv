ssc_504030_0030#0,"""...Mmmm."""
ssc_504030_0040#0,"""What are you doing?"""
ssc_504030_0050#0,"""Working?"""
ssc_504030_0060#0,"""Oh! It's you."""
ssc_504030_0070#0,"""I was just checking our data<br>regarding the Central Cannon."""
ssc_504030_0080#0,"""Hm? Ah, it's you."""
ssc_504030_0090#0,"""Just checking some of<br>the Central Cannon data."""
ssc_504030_0100#0,"""Since you're here, why don't I<br>tell you a bit about this weapon?"""
ssc_504030_0110#0,"""They call it the Central Cannon, but apparently, its official name<br>is the Single-Mounted Photon Particle Cannon."""
ssc_504030_0120#0,"""I say \""apparently\""... because it's<br>also a piece of lost technology."""
ssc_504030_0130#0,"""By whom, when, and why it was built<br>remains as of yet a mystery, however."""
ssc_504030_0140#0,"""Its original purpose for us was as a communications antenna,<br>which has since become foundational to Central City."""
ssc_504030_0150#0,"""Connected to the facilities underground the way it is,<br>you could say it's like the City's foundational pillar."""
ssc_504030_0160#0,"""The City's Central Cannon was<br>broken from the outset, you see."""
ssc_504030_0170#0,"""It was my grandfather, Vanford, who began<br>the effort to see it repaired."""
ssc_504030_0180#0,"""No, let me correct myself.<br>It wasn't broken, but rather... incomplete."""
ssc_504030_0190#0,"""At first, it seems that countless<br>parts of it were missing."""
ssc_504030_0200#0,"""From analyzing its construction, they knew it would require<br>a great deal of time to manufacture them all."""
ssc_504030_0210#0,"""It wasn't able to be brought back into working order during<br>my grandfather's or my father's generation."""
ssc_504030_0220#0,"""The project was meant to be handed down to me, but...<br>A series of events happened."""
ssc_504030_0230#0,"""Despite the fact that we've been able to get it to fire,<br>there is still much room for improvement."""
ssc_504030_0240#0,"""Particularly regarding the durability<br>of the parts we manufacture."""
ssc_504030_0250#0,"""Actually... Long ago,<br>a single test firing was conducted."""
ssc_504030_0260#0,"""...You know the mountain in the direction of the Shop Area<br>you can see off in the distance?"""
ssc_504030_0270#0,"""...Wait, are you saying..."""
ssc_504030_0280#0,"""Mt. Mahina Pari?"""
ssc_504030_0290#0,"""I am. That mountain's crescent shape is the aftermath of<br>the Central Cannon's very first shot."""
ssc_504030_0300#0,"""Exactly. The shape of that mountain is<br>the aftermath of that test-firing."""
ssc_504030_0310#0,"""They had originally intended to fire it at a much lower output,<br>but due to an error in configuration, it fired at its maximum output."""
ssc_504030_0320#0,"""It damaged the barrel, as well as parts of the control unit."""
ssc_504030_0330#0,"""This brought to light a flaw in its design."""
ssc_504030_0340#0,"""As for me, memory of that failure is a<br>source of embarrassment for me, but..."""
ssc_504030_0350#0,"""As a researcher, I view it as a sign that development<br>was progressing, so there are mixed feelings."""
ssc_504030_0360#0,"""That is to say, by way of trial and error, we<br>have finally reached a practical-usage stage."""
ssc_504030_0370#0,"""Unfortunately, however, it's not something<br>we can simply take our time with."""
ssc_504030_0380#0,"""In order to repair it further,<br>much more effort will be required."""
ssc_504030_0390#0,"""To that end I expect great things<br>from you, Manon, and Aina."""
ssc_504030_0400#0,"""Once again, I thank you for<br>your continued efforts."""
