msc_014040_0010#0,"""Alright, let's get started. First, the results of our investigation into Lost Central..."""
msc_014040_0020#0,"""We've managed to ascertain<br>the potential whereabouts of Dark Falz."""
msc_014040_0030#0,"""That location would be<br>deep in the heart of the Stia Region."""
msc_014040_0040#0,"""Thanks to everyone's efforts, we've completed<br>the Central Cannon. It can be fired at a moment's notice."""
msc_014040_0050#0,"""The plan is to lure Dark Falz to the surface..."""
msc_014040_0060#0,"""...and when he gets within range of the cannon, fire!<br>Putting an end to this long battle."""
msc_014040_0070#0,"""This is all much easier said than done, of course."""
msc_014040_0080#0,"""The Stia Region happens to be one of Halpha's most dangerous areas."""
msc_014040_0090#0,"""There are two reasons. The first being that the entire<br>Stia Region is covered in massive quantities of magma."""
msc_014040_0100#0,"""The second being the discovery of a plurality of<br>new DOLLS of incomparable strength."""
msc_014040_0110#0,"""It sounds easy on paper... but this will certainly<br>be your most dangerous and grueling mission yet."""
msc_014040_0120#0,"""I ask that you all steel your resolve.<br>Let's make sure we win this."""
msc_014040_0130#0,"""Right, understood! I've just got<br>one question, if you don't mind me asking..."""
msc_014040_0140#0,"""Are there any ARKS in the Stia Region?<br>Like Nadereh's or Ilma's people?"""
msc_014040_0150#0,"""I mean, every time we get sent to a new region, there's always<br>been fellow ARKS to coordinate efforts against the DOLLS..."""
msc_014040_0160#0,"""It'd just put my mind at ease<br>knowing we've got allies there, that's all."""
msc_014040_0170#0,"""Ah, yes... A vanguard unit has been<br>developing in the Stia Region, yes."""
msc_014040_0180#0,"""If only we had a<br>means to contact them..."""
msc_014040_0190#0,"""But... we do? The forward party is<br>set up at the Stia Camp, sir."""
msc_014040_0200#0,"""I'll just go ahead and patch us through now."""
msc_014040_0210#0,"""...Agh!<br>Wait!"""
msc_014040_0220#0,"""Yoohoo! This is Operator Noroshi speaking!"""
msc_014040_0230#0,"""...And so we'd like to coordinate<br>a strategy to take down Dark Falz."""
msc_014040_0240#0,"""Yup yup! You betcha! So, what shall we do, Commander?"""
msc_014040_0250#0,"""...Crawford."""
msc_014040_0260#0,"""Ahhh...<br>It's been a while, Guren."""
msc_014040_0270#0,"""Noroshi got me up to speed.<br>No objections here."""
msc_014040_0280#0,"""...Thank you."""
msc_014040_0290#0,"""...Kanui."""
msc_014040_0300#0,"""You're our liaison."""
msc_014040_0310#0,"""...Understood."""
msc_014040_0320#0,"""This is Adjudant Kanui speaking."""
msc_014040_0325#0,"""Mr. Crawford, Rossa, Oranje,<br>long time no see."""
msc_014040_0330#0,"""Lodging will be prepared<br>for your arrivals."""
msc_014040_0340#0,"""Take care."""
msc_014040_0350#0,"""...Are you two still at odds...?"""
msc_014040_0360#0,"""...No, not as much as we used to be.<br>It'll work out. I won't make the same mistake."""
msc_014040_0370#0,"""...Well, please set off for the Stia Region<br>after making doubly sure that you're prepared."""
msc_014040_0380#0,"""I pray for your success."""
