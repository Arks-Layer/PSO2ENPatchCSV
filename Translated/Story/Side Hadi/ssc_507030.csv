ssc_507030_0010#0,"""Ah, <%me>."""
ssc_507030_0020#0,"""What are you up to?"""
ssc_507030_0030#0,"""Got some business down there?"""
ssc_507030_0040#0,"""We got a request from some people in Aelio<br>to investigate Maqaad's lower levels."""
ssc_507030_0050#0,"""I was just feeling the breeze<br>as I gathered my thoughts."""
ssc_507030_0060#0,"""Aye. Fulfilling a request<br>from some people in Aelio."""
ssc_507030_0070#0,"""I'm headed into Maqaad's lower levels<br>to carry out an investigation."""
ssc_507030_0080#0,"""As you're also likely aware, there's<br>a vast chamber beyond this entrance here."""
ssc_507030_0090#0,"""A chamber lined with a series<br>of massive structures."""
ssc_507030_0100#0,"""According to past literature, it's all<br>referred to as an \""energy plant\""."""
ssc_507030_0110#0,"""In other words, the devices inside were<br>made to produce some kind of energy."""
ssc_507030_0120#0,"""Alas, until recently, we've not been able to afford<br>the manpower for any investigations beyond that."""
ssc_507030_0130#0,"""We've only ever known this place<br>as \""Lenus Retem's stronghold\""."""
ssc_507030_0140#0,"""Now, however, we have a bit<br>more flexibility with our schedule."""
ssc_507030_0150#0,"""Which brings me to this request from Aelio."""
ssc_507030_0160#0,"""I've been interested in this place for<br>a while now, so I signed up for it."""
ssc_507030_0170#0,"""Aelio has also been sending some of their own investigators,<br>so we've been getting a lot of good data recently."""
ssc_507030_0180#0,"""It has all been a rather valuable<br>new experience for me, as well."""
ssc_507030_0190#0,"""Though things have been slow-going, we've uncovered<br>some interesting things about this plant."""
ssc_507030_0200#0,"""Like how certain portions<br>of it are still operating."""
ssc_507030_0210#0,"""It also appears that some of the power it<br>generates is being sent to Retem City."""
ssc_507030_0220#0,"""It seems that it can operate almost in perpetuity<br>without anyone having to maintain it."""
ssc_507030_0230#0,"""It's unlike any machine I could've imagined."""
ssc_507030_0240#0,"""In any case, it's ironic that a facility built by our<br>enemies is also being used to fuel our survival."""
ssc_507030_0250#0,"""...There is one more thing."""
ssc_507030_0260#0,"""Within the Maqaad facility, we found<br>something relating to the DOLLS."""
ssc_507030_0270#0,"""What kind of something?"""
ssc_507030_0280#0,"""Relating in what way?"""
ssc_507030_0290#0,"""I don't know the details yet."""
ssc_507030_0300#0,"""Just that the examiners from Aelio found something with<br>a connection to the DOLLS in one part of the facility."""
ssc_507030_0310#0,"""Ah, it's all still under investigation."""
ssc_507030_0320#0,"""Just that, in one part of the facility, they found something<br>with a composition similar to that of the DOLLS."""
ssc_507030_0330#0,"""We've always thought that it was just a building<br>that the DOLLS decided to gather in..."""
ssc_507030_0340#0,"""But if the DOLLS have some sort of relation<br>to the building itself, that raises some suspicions."""
ssc_507030_0350#0,"""...Well, we still can't draw<br>any conclusions at the moment."""
ssc_507030_0360#0,"""I'll keep you all informed<br>if we figure anything else out."""
ssc_507030_0370#0,"""Phew... Really though, who knew I'd find something<br>that would interest me outside of combat or music?"""
ssc_507030_0380#0,"""Perhaps in a different life, I would<br>have become a researcher."""
ssc_507030_0390#0,"""Goodness, life really is just a series<br>of unpredictable events, isn't it?"""
