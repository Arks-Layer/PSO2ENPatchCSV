ssc_503020_0020#0,"""What are you up to, Bruder?"""
ssc_503020_0030#0,"""I'm just gathering some food supplies."""
ssc_503020_0040#0,"""I just happen to be walking<br>off the beaten path during a patrol mission."""
ssc_503020_0050#0,"""This place somewhat reminds me of the past."""
ssc_503020_0060#0,"""I see."""
ssc_503020_0070#0,"""I'm just stopping by during one of my patrol missions."""
ssc_503020_0080#0,"""This place somewhat reminds me of the past."""
ssc_503020_0090#0,"""I'm also a Meteorn, you know.<br>Just like you and Manon."""
ssc_503020_0100#0,"""This coast is where I landed."""
ssc_503020_0110#0,"""...Can't forget that day."""
ssc_503020_0120#0,"""Just having stepped outside of my pod with no<br>idea what was going on, there I stood."""
ssc_503020_0130#0,"""Next thing I know, I'm being surrounded by enemies."""
ssc_503020_0140#0,"""Somehow I already knew how to use the weapon in my hand,<br>but I was vastly outnumbered."""
ssc_503020_0150#0,"""Slowly but surely, the enemies started to overwhelm me."""
ssc_503020_0160#0,"""It looked like that's where it was going to end for me.<br>Before I even knew who I was..."""
ssc_503020_0170#0,"""When suddenly, a single ARKS appeared."""
ssc_503020_0180#0,"""This man started taking the enemies down one by one.<br>Bearing down on them like a flash of lightning."""
ssc_503020_0190#0,"""And that man... was Crawford."""
ssc_503020_0200#0,"""He hadn't yet become the Central Leader.<br>This was back when he was but a simple ARKS member."""
ssc_503020_0210#0,"""Apparently he had just happened to be in the area to see<br>my pod fall from the sky, and he came to recover me."""
ssc_503020_0220#0,"""He carried what was left of me back to the City<br>and had all of my damaged parts repaired."""
ssc_503020_0230#0,"""And then he welcomed me into<br>Central City as one of its citizens."""
ssc_503020_0240#0,"""After that, he taught me about<br>how to live here on Halpha."""
ssc_503020_0250#0,"""Including how to fight, of course.<br>Started me right from the basics."""
ssc_503020_0260#0,"""Crawford really saved your life, huh."""
ssc_503020_0270#0,"""Crawford taught you how to fight?"""
ssc_503020_0280#0,"""Aye. I owe him a debt that I doubt<br>I'll ever be able to repay."""
ssc_503020_0290#0,"""Aye. That perfectionist had quite the thorough curriculum."""
ssc_503020_0300#0,"""He was a strict teacher, too. The guidance I gave you and the girls was a trifle by comparison."""
ssc_503020_0310#0,"""I stand here today entirely thanks to Crawford."""
ssc_503020_0320#0,"""Now I work for him, as some small way<br>of repaying my debt to him."""
ssc_503020_0330#0,"""I'd also like you to support him as well."""
ssc_503020_0340#0,"""There aren't many people who know and support<br>the man behind all his charisma."""
ssc_503020_0350#0,"""I'd appreciate it if you did."""
