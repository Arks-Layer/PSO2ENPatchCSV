ssc_503070_0010#0,"""Hey there. You've returned to Aelio, I see."""
ssc_503070_0020#0,"""I heard you completed your mission in Stia."""
ssc_503070_0030#0,"""We just helped out Guren's team."""
ssc_503070_0040#0,"""Thanks entirely to Crawford."""
ssc_503070_0050#0,"""They're an elite unit, but they've<br>been sorely lacking in numbers."""
ssc_503070_0060#0,"""There's no doubt that your aid<br>completely turned their situation around."""
ssc_503070_0070#0,"""...Be that as it may, there was<br>also Crawford's split-second decision to act."""
ssc_503070_0080#0,"""Aye, that surprised me as well."""
ssc_503070_0090#0,"""I certainly didn't expect to hear<br>Crawford suggest going to Stia himself."""
ssc_503070_0100#0,"""Nilus Stia was an arch-enemy for<br>both him and Guren."""
ssc_503070_0110#0,"""While he may have said \""I'll let<br>Guren take care of it\""..."""
ssc_503070_0120#0,"""He must've really wanted to settle the<br>score himself--or rather, together with Guren."""
ssc_503070_0130#0,"""Thankfully, at the time there was only<br>light DOLLS activity here in Aelio."""
ssc_503070_0140#0,"""There couldn't have been a better chance<br>for him to act."""
ssc_503070_0150#0,"""That's why I was able to insist that he<br>go do what he needed to do."""
ssc_503070_0160#0,"""Thanks to that, those three were able to<br>obtain some measure of closure."""
ssc_503070_0170#0,"""Crawford, Guren, and Hibana..."""
ssc_503070_0180#0,"""Kanui told me about Hibana."""
ssc_503070_0190#0,"""Yeah, Hibana's the one who..."""
ssc_503070_0200#0,"""I see..."""
ssc_503070_0210#0,"""Ah, so you knew about Hibana."""
ssc_503070_0220#0,"""Hibana and Guren had known each other<br>for a long time."""
ssc_503070_0230#0,"""She was a peculiar woman who could<br>make fast friends with anyone."""
ssc_503070_0240#0,"""Aina somewhat resembles her in that way,<br>though Hibana carried herself differently."""
ssc_503070_0250#0,"""Eventually they met Crawford, and the three<br>of them would start working together."""
ssc_503070_0260#0,"""Crawford and Guren's relationship now isn't<br>much different from how it was back then."""
ssc_503070_0270#0,"""They always differed in opinion,<br>and argued quite often."""
ssc_503070_0280#0,"""The one who would always get them<br>to calm down was Hibana."""
ssc_503070_0290#0,"""She could immediately find common ground<br>between them, and they'd start cooperating."""
ssc_503070_0300#0,"""Hibana was intuitive like that."""
ssc_503070_0310#0,"""On many occasions, she could judge the<br>situation and find the best course of action."""
ssc_503070_0320#0,"""Quite the opposite to Crawford,<br>who was always about theorizing."""
ssc_503070_0330#0,"""One way or another, they got along well."""
ssc_503070_0340#0,"""Despite their different temperaments, the<br>three of them looked like a natural unit."""
ssc_503070_0350#0,"""They were especially mesmerizing<br>when coordinating in battle."""
ssc_503070_0360#0,"""Guren took point, Crawford guarded<br>the rear, and Hibana fought freely in between."""
ssc_503070_0370#0,"""Just the three of them could take down<br>powerful DOLLS one after the other."""
ssc_503070_0380#0,"""Nearly everyone in Aelio looked up<br>to them as role models."""
ssc_503070_0390#0,"""That's precisely why Hibana's<br>death left such a big vacuum."""
ssc_503070_0400#0,"""Having lost her, Crawford and Guren both<br>focused entirely on the separate paths they believed in."""
ssc_503070_0410#0,"""Now that their score with<br>Nilus Stia has been settled..."""
ssc_503070_0420#0,"""Perhaps those two<br>can now fill that vacuum."""
ssc_503070_0430#0,"""Hm? Ah, it seems<br>there's trouble."""
ssc_503070_0440#0,"""Apologies, but I should<br>head over there to help."""
ssc_503070_0450#0,"""Hopefully we can talk again soon."""
ssc_503070_0460#0,"""Take care."""
