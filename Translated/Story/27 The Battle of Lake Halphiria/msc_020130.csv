msc_020130_0010#0,"""...Alright, I want to prioritize the decryption of this data."""
msc_020130_0020#0,"""Understood, sir. I'll<br>assign our best teams to it."""
msc_020130_0030#0,"""Hey there, you two."""
msc_020130_0040#0,"""What's the matter?"""
msc_020130_0050#0,"""Crawford! It's Manon...!"""
msc_020130_0060#0,"""Mmm..."""
msc_020130_0070#0,"""I want you two to take a look at this."""
msc_020130_0080#0,"""This is the giant structure floating in the skies of Halpha."""
msc_020130_0090#0,"""Internally, we've called it the \""Floating Island\"", but..."""
msc_020130_0100#0,"""U-Uh... What's this about?"""
msc_020130_0110#0,"""Leciel."""
msc_020130_0120#0,"""...That's its official name, apparently."""
msc_020130_0130#0,"""Manon sent us this data not too long ago."""
msc_020130_0140#0,"""Wait, Manon did?"""
msc_020130_0150#0,"""This really came from Manon?"""
msc_020130_0160#0,"""...Yeah."""
msc_020130_0170#0,"""While not fully conclusive, the sender's<br>address was certainly Manon's."""
msc_020130_0180#0,"""Wait a minute."""
msc_020130_0190#0,"""What does this Leciel have to do with Manon?"""
msc_020130_0200#0,"""...I'm going to be blunt here."""
msc_020130_0210#0,"""Manon knows the secrets of this world."""
msc_020130_0220#0,"""...What?"""
msc_020130_0230#0,"""We've only just started our analysis of this data, but..."""
msc_020130_0240#0,"""Just from what we've uncovered already, it's full of<br>information we most likely would've never learned."""
msc_020130_0250#0,"""It goes far beyond anything in Rysas' documents."""
msc_020130_0260#0,"""We're not sure why Manon was in possession of something like this..."""
msc_020130_0270#0,"""Nor why she would send it to us now."""
msc_020130_0280#0,"""I... I don't even..."""
msc_020130_0290#0,"""So, where's Manon heading now?"""
msc_020130_0300#0,"""Is Manon going to Leciel?"""
msc_020130_0310#0,"""...Most likely to this Leciel."""
msc_020130_0320#0,"""Circumstances would suggest that she is, yes."""
msc_020130_0330#0,"""Alas, even if we wanted to confirm that,<br>we have no means of travel to that place."""
msc_020130_0340#0,"""I suspect it'll take quite a<br>while to even formulate a plan."""
msc_020130_0350#0,"""Agh..."""
msc_020130_0360#0,"""It was so sudden that even I'm<br>still trying to gather my bearings."""
msc_020130_0370#0,"""...I knew something was bothering Manon..."""
msc_020130_0380#0,"""...But I never thought it<br>was something like this..."""
msc_020130_0390#0,"""..."""
msc_020130_0400#0,"""...Indeed. Perhaps if I had<br>paid closer attention to her..."""
msc_020130_0410#0,"""First, we need to analyze this data."""
msc_020130_0420#0,"""If she had a way to travel to<br>Leciel without any special equipm--"""
msc_020130_0430#0,"""Emergency alert! I'm picking up<br>a huge amount of DOLLS signals!"""
msc_020130_0440#0,"""What?! Where?!"""
msc_020130_0450#0,"""Retem! Very close to Retem City!"""
msc_020130_0460#0,"""You there, Crawford? We've got a bunch of<br>unwelcome visitors near Retem City."""
msc_020130_0470#0,"""Aye, we detected them as well.<br>Will you need backup?"""
msc_020130_0480#0,"""I'd like to say no, but there's even more DOLLS<br>than when we fought Lenus Retem."""
msc_020130_0490#0,"""Understood. I'll send reinforcements immediately."""
msc_020130_0500#0,"""Cheers. ...Also..."""
msc_020130_0510#0,"""What is it?"""
msc_020130_0520#0,"""It looks like a Meteorn Pod fell down<br>at the center of these DOLLS."""
msc_020130_0530#0,"""We're prioritizing their rescue.<br>I'm going with a rapid-response strategy."""
msc_020130_0540#0,"""Understood. I'll relay that to our<br>support and send them your way."""
msc_020130_0550#0,"""Appreciate it."""
msc_020130_0560#0,"""A Meteorn Pod?! Maybe Manon is<br>involved or something!"""
msc_020130_0570#0,"""Let's go, Aina!"""
msc_020130_0580#0,"""What's the plan, Aina?"""
msc_020130_0590#0,"""Yeah!"""
msc_020130_0600#0,"""We move out!"""
msc_020130_0605#0,"""Wait! I want you two on standby."""
msc_020130_0610#0,"""We're not just gonna<br>sit around and do nothing!"""
msc_020130_0620#0,"""If we're wrong, then so be it!<br>We want to move forward, no matter what!"""
msc_020130_0630#0,"""A-Alright."""
msc_020130_0640#0,"""Just don't be reckless out there."""
msc_020130_0650#0,"""Understood!"""
