ssc_501110_0020#0,"""It's not dry like Retem's air...<br>It's like there's heat from head-to-toe."""
ssc_501110_0030#0,"""<%me>, does the heat really not bother you here?"""
ssc_501110_0040#0,"""Nope."""
ssc_501110_0050#0,"""Honestly, it kind of does."""
ssc_501110_0060#0,"""I see..."""
ssc_501110_0070#0,"""I guess it really must be<br>a Meteorn thing or something..."""
ssc_501110_0080#0,"""What? It does?"""
ssc_501110_0090#0,"""You seemed totally fine<br>in Retem and Kvaris, though."""
ssc_501110_0100#0,"""Well, I guess it's a good thing, since<br>we get sent to a bunch of different places..."""
ssc_501110_0110#0,"""Guren and his team have pretty much<br>lived here for a really long time."""
ssc_501110_0120#0,"""Sure, dealing with the DOLLS is hard enough,<br>but the worst enemy in Stia is probably the heat."""
ssc_501110_0130#0,"""It's hard to cool off after a tiring battle<br>when it's always like this."""
ssc_501110_0140#0,"""Everyone's always fighting,<br>whether it's night or day..."""
ssc_501110_0150#0,"""It'd be nice if at least the camp was comfortable..."""
ssc_501110_0160#0,"""I guess that's not...<br>any of my business, though."""
ssc_501110_0170#0,"""I wonder if there's anything we could do for them...?"""
ssc_501110_0180#0,"""Maybe some sort of gift?"""
ssc_501110_0190#0,"""Something to take their mind off of it?"""
ssc_501110_0200#0,"""A gift...? Hmmm...<br>Let me think."""
ssc_501110_0210#0,"""Oh, that's right!"""
ssc_501110_0220#0,"""I could cook some food for everyone, like<br>back when we were near Stia's central region."""
ssc_501110_0230#0,"""Take their mind off of it...<br>Hmmm... Let me think."""
ssc_501110_0240#0,"""Ah! Do you think they'd like it<br>if I made food for everyone again?"""
ssc_501110_0250#0,"""Everyone's been eating like stale bread and stuff,<br>so I'm sure they'd enjoy some good food for once."""
ssc_501110_0260#0,"""Yeah, that'll work!"""
ssc_501110_0270#0,"""Thanks for the advice!"""
ssc_501110_0280#0,"""First, I'll have to arrange the ingredients."""
ssc_501110_0290#0,"""Let's see..."""
ssc_501110_0300#0,"""Back then, everyone was physically and<br>mentally exhausted, so I cooked something warm..."""
ssc_501110_0310#0,"""So this time, I think I'll<br>make something cold and refreshing."""
ssc_501110_0320#0,"""I could make something good with fruits and veggies from Kvaris."""
ssc_501110_0330#0,"""Yeah, alright, I've got an idea!"""
ssc_501110_0340#0,"""I'll start looking right away."""
