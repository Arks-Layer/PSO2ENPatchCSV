ssc_501130_0020#0,"""What're you up to?"""
ssc_501130_0030#0,"""What are you two talking about?"""
ssc_501130_0040#0,"""Oh, I just was asking Crawford about Zephetto."""
ssc_501130_0050#0,"""Just talking a bit about Zephetto"""
ssc_501130_0060#0,"""About what exactly<br>Zephetto was doing here on Halpha."""
ssc_501130_0070#0,"""I figured if we knew that, it might lead<br>to a hint in our fight against the Starless."""
ssc_501130_0080#0,"""We've uncovered much of his intel<br>thanks to our talks with the Lecielans."""
ssc_501130_0090#0,"""It's just, there's so much data to go<br>over that it'll take a while to analyze it all."""
ssc_501130_0100#0,"""It's 500 years worth of intelligence, after all."""
ssc_501130_0110#0,"""What's more, not many of those documents remain on Halpha."""
ssc_501130_0120#0,"""So he's really been at this for that long?"""
ssc_501130_0130#0,"""That sounds pretty overwhelming."""
ssc_501130_0140#0,"""Judging by the data,<br>there's little doubt about it."""
ssc_501130_0150#0,"""It certainly is."""
ssc_501130_0160#0,"""First, what we do know is<br>that he wasn't always a Cast."""
ssc_501130_0170#0,"""As his activities became prolonged, it seems that he<br>had his body mechanized to extend his lifespan."""
ssc_501130_0180#0,"""...He went that far..."""
ssc_501130_0190#0,"""Aye. He dedicated everything for his experiment."""
ssc_501130_0200#0,"""...At first, it seems the experiments on Halpha<br>did take safety and security into account."""
ssc_501130_0210#0,"""But, it didn't produce enough results for him."""
ssc_501130_0220#0,"""Before long, the DOLLS were being manufactured, and the<br>experiment changed to focus more on live combat."""
ssc_501130_0230#0,"""And then, the most significant results came when<br>Dark Falz was introduced to the experiment."""
ssc_501130_0240#0,"""By overcoming a life-threatening battle<br>with an overwhelmingly powerful enemy..."""
ssc_501130_0250#0,"""The surviving ARKS would rapidly<br>undergo significant Photon attenuation."""
ssc_501130_0260#0,"""And then, we were forced to<br>fight Dark Falz as well..."""
ssc_501130_0270#0,"""Personally, my emotions won't allow me<br>to forgive Zephetto for what he's done."""
ssc_501130_0280#0,"""But, I can also somewhat<br>understand his sentiment."""
ssc_501130_0290#0,"""Because I too seek to do<br>all that I can as Aelio's leader."""
ssc_501130_0300#0,"""I would do anything for the<br>good of the people of Aelio."""
ssc_501130_0310#0,"""...Of course, I wouldn't go about it<br>with methods like his, though."""
ssc_501130_0320#0,"""...\""I've accomplished what I set out to do.\""<br>That was one of the last things he said."""
ssc_501130_0330#0,"""If that's true, then we should have<br>some means of fighting the Starless."""
ssc_501130_0340#0,"""...And I most certainly hope it is."""
