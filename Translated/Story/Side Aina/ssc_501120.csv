ssc_501120_0010#0,"""Ah, heeey!"""
ssc_501120_0020#0,"""Hey there."""
ssc_501120_0030#0,"""Now here's a rare sight."""
ssc_501120_0040#0,"""Ilma, why're you here?"""
ssc_501120_0050#0,"""I was called in to attend<br>Manon and the others' hearings."""
ssc_501120_0060#0,"""I was called in to attend<br>Manon and the others' hearings."""
ssc_501120_0070#0,"""And I just wanted to ask him how it went."""
ssc_501120_0080#0,"""You can both rest easy.<br>Both Manon and Faria are doing well."""
ssc_501120_0090#0,"""I can imagine it's rather nerve-wracking,<br>but they didn't look unhappy with their treatment."""
ssc_501120_0100#0,"""The same could be said for the other Resurgent ARKS."""
ssc_501120_0110#0,"""There is just one problem..."""
ssc_501120_0120#0,"""Did the hearing not go well?"""
ssc_501120_0130#0,"""Couldn't come to a conclusion?"""
ssc_501120_0140#0,"""Yeeeah. They're not making it very easy for us."""
ssc_501120_0150#0,"""Well, there is that, too."""
ssc_501120_0160#0,"""They all had their own roles to play on Leciel,<br>each of them with different responsibilities."""
ssc_501120_0170#0,"""As a result, some testimonies couldn't be corroborated,<br>so we've had troubles coming to definite conclusions."""
ssc_501120_0180#0,"""But, what's even more troublesome than that..."""
ssc_501120_0190#0,"""...is the issue of making ourselves mutually understood."""
ssc_501120_0200#0,"""For example, \""Can you tell us about Leciel?\""<br>...That's a question, right?"""
ssc_501120_0210#0,"""But if you asked them, they'd start explaining the structure of<br>Leciel itself, and its various functions, down to every little detail."""
ssc_501120_0220#0,"""As if they were emotionless machines responding to a data query."""
ssc_501120_0230#0,"""...Manon was like that when she first arrived."""
ssc_501120_0240#0,"""You'd talk to her and she'd<br>just give bare-minimum responses."""
ssc_501120_0250#0,"""People weren't really sure what to do about her."""
ssc_501120_0260#0,"""Maybe that's just normal for them."""
ssc_501120_0270#0,"""But Manon is different now."""
ssc_501120_0280#0,"""Yeah."""
ssc_501120_0290#0,"""We're actually able to reach a<br>measure of understanding with Manon."""
ssc_501120_0300#0,"""Perhaps, if given enough time, the others<br>may also eventually change like she has..."""
ssc_501120_0310#0,"""...That's what I'd like to think."""
ssc_501120_0320#0,"""Also, another thing about them..."""
ssc_501120_0330#0,"""From now on, we're going to refer to their people as \""Lecielan\""."""
ssc_501120_0340#0,"""Lecielan?"""
ssc_501120_0350#0,"""They're no longer our enemies."""
ssc_501120_0360#0,"""If we just keep calling them \""Resurgent ARKS\"",<br>it could harm our rapport with them."""
ssc_501120_0370#0,"""Ahh..."""
ssc_501120_0380#0,"""...Lecielan."""
ssc_501120_0390#0,"""Yeah. It sounds nice."""
