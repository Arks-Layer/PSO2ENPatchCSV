ssc_501050_0030#0,"""I've been in Resol Forest before, but it's<br>really awful when you're out here alone."""
ssc_501050_0040#0,"""The enemies are so strong, and you never know<br>where or when they might jump out at you."""
ssc_501050_0050#0,"""On top of that, the atmosphere of this place is terrify--...<br>Er, terribly hard to get used to."""
ssc_501050_0060#0,"""But, I've gotten a lot better at fighting<br>compared to when we first came to Resol Forest."""
ssc_501050_0070#0,"""Back then, I was such a bundle of nerves<br>I could barely keep up with you and Manon."""
ssc_501050_0080#0,"""I couldn't even remember which<br>paths we'd already been down..."""
ssc_501050_0090#0,"""But I feel like being able to overcome that battle<br>was like a huge milestone for me."""
ssc_501050_0100#0,"""Really, I owe it all to you and Manon, <%me>."""
ssc_501050_0110#0,"""We all promised to fight together, after all."""
ssc_501050_0120#0,"""We've gotta keep an eye on you, after all."""
ssc_501050_0130#0,"""Yeah. Yeah, we did. Thanks."""
ssc_501050_0140#0,"""Now don't you start<br>sounding like my Dad!"""
ssc_501050_0150#0,"""Seriously though, I appreciate it. Thanks."""
ssc_501050_0160#0,"""When I heard Bruder went missing<br>at the same time Nex Aelio showed up..."""
ssc_501050_0170#0,"""All I could think about was saving him,<br>so I just threw my hand up and volunteered."""
ssc_501050_0180#0,"""Even though I had no idea what I was up against,<br>or even what kind of place Resol Forest was like."""
ssc_501050_0190#0,"""But when you and Manon volunteered right next to me,<br>you both gave me the courage to follow through."""
ssc_501050_0200#0,"""I felt like, as long as I'm with you and Manon,<br>we can stand up against any sort of enemy."""
ssc_501050_0210#0,"""...My Dad always got mad at me like<br>\""You need to think before you act!\"", and stuff."""
ssc_501050_0220#0,"""But he'd let me down easy and say<br>\""Still, it's better than overthinking it and not acting at all.\""."""
ssc_501050_0230#0,"""I think it might actually be a part of my nature."""
ssc_501050_0240#0,"""Say, <%me>. Hypothetically speaking, can you stop me<br>if it looks like I'm about to do something really reckless?"""
ssc_501050_0250#0,"""You and Manon really know how to<br>calm me down and help keep me focused."""
ssc_501050_0260#0,"""You got it."""
ssc_501050_0270#0,"""You'd better not do anything reckless though."""
ssc_501050_0280#0,"""Good. Thanks."""
ssc_501050_0290#0,"""Hypothetically! I'm just speaking hypothetically here."""
ssc_501050_0300#0,"""On the off chance I lose sense<br>of my surroundings again, you know?"""
ssc_501050_0310#0,"""We've gotta look out for<br>each other after all, right?"""
