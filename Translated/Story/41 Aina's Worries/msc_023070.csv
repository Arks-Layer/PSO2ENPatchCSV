msc_023070_0010#0,"""Oh? Welcome!"""
msc_023070_0020#0,"""If you told me you were coming, I would've made something for us..."""
msc_023070_0030#0,"""How are things in Aelio?"""
msc_023070_0040#0,"""Ilma's been heading over there a lot lately.<br>He's not causing you all any trouble, is he?"""
msc_023070_0050#0,"""He spends most of his time researching something."""
msc_023070_0060#0,"""Actually, I'm not really sure what he gets up to."""
msc_023070_0070#0,"""I guess he's the same no matter where he is, huh..."""
msc_023070_0080#0,"""Oh? You don't?"""
msc_023070_0090#0,"""Well, he's probably huddled away<br>researching one thing or another."""
msc_023070_0100#0,"""At least he doesn't seem to be<br>getting up to any trouble."""
msc_023070_0110#0,"""That's reassuring to hear."""
msc_023070_0120#0,"""If he starts getting into any funny business,<br>you let me know right away, alright?"""
msc_023070_0130#0,"""...Ah, that reminds me."""
msc_023070_0140#0,"""Aina visited me a little while ago."""
msc_023070_0150#0,"""She did?"""
msc_023070_0160#0,"""On some sort of errand?"""
msc_023070_0170#0,"""Yeah."""
msc_023070_0180#0,"""She wanted me to tell her what kind of combat training we've done over here."""
msc_023070_0190#0,"""She wanted to know what kind of combat training we've done over here."""
msc_023070_0200#0,"""Aina told me how she's become a training instructor."""
msc_023070_0210#0,"""I think it's a good fit for her; she loves helping people."""
msc_023070_0220#0,"""So I told her about the fighting styles that our Grandpa taught us."""
msc_023070_0230#0,"""You know how my brothers and I all have really different personalities?"""
msc_023070_0240#0,"""Yeah, that certainly didn't make it easy for Grandpa to teach us."""
msc_023070_0250#0,"""He would always say something like \""Adapting to your individuality is vital\""."""
msc_023070_0260#0,"""He would try teaching us one way, and if that failed, he'd move onto another method."""
msc_023070_0270#0,"""Eventually, he found fighting styles that suited all of us and patiently lectured us, one by one."""
msc_023070_0280#0,"""And, hypothetically speaking..."""
msc_023070_0290#0,"""If Grandpa had just told us to do things the way HE did them..."""
msc_023070_0300#0,"""Our personalities might've have just become more like his own."""
msc_023070_0310#0,"""...And when I told Aina about that, she was like<br>\""Wow, I've only thought about it from my own perspective...\"""""
msc_023070_0320#0,"""She didn't stay long after that."""
msc_023070_0330#0,"""I kinda wanted to talk to her a bit more..."""
msc_023070_0340#0,"""So what about you?"""
msc_023070_0350#0,"""I'd love to hear about what you've been up to lately."""
