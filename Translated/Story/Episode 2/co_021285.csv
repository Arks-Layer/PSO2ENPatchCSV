text01#0,"""This explains Crafting.  Crafting is a system for <yellow>rewriting items and Techniques<c>, for instance by rewriting the parameters of weapons and units, or by creating disks to adjust the performance of Techniques. <yellow>■Main types of Crafting<c> <green>Weapon Extension<c> This allows you to take weapons and units and <cff007f>rewrite their parameters in specific ways<c>. Unlike with grinding, even initially-weak equipment can be rewritten to become much more powerful. <green>Technique Customization<c> This creates a Custom Disk which adjusts the performance of a learned Technique in various ways. Apply the effect of the Custom Disk by using it."""
text02#0,"""<green>PA Customization<c> This creates a Custom Disk which adjusts the performance of a learned Photon Art in various ways. Apply the effect of the Custom Disk by using it. \u3000<green>Timed Ability Installation<c> This adds a random effect to units. The effect has various restrictions on it, such as only applying in certain conditions, and lasting for a limited time, but the strength of the effect makes up for the restrictions."""
text03#0,"""Crafting is executed from the <yellow>My Room Terminal<c>.  Performing crafts and <yellow>unlocking Crafting Achievements<c> will raise your <yellow>Craft Level<c>, and allow you to create higher-ranked or higher quality crafts.  In addition, other players can order Craft Requests from you. You can register what you want to craft and your comments by selecting \""Signboard Settings\"" from the \""Crafting\"" menu of your Room Terminal.  <yellow>■A shortcut to levelling up<c> Since your crafting level rises with the number of Crafting Achievements you unlock, performing the same crafts over and over won't raise your level very quickly. Try dabbling in a broad range of crafts instead."""
text04#0,"""In addition to performing crafts yourself, you can also order them from other players. You can issue Craft Orders from <yellow>the My Room Terminal in another player's room.<c>  ※You can use \""Craft\"" → \""Crafter Search\"" from the Visiphone to find crafters and travel to their rooms.  You can always issue Craft Orders for recipes even if you cannot create them yourself."""
text05#0,"""Items that you've ordered from other players can be accepted or cancelled at the Visiphone by selecting \""Craft\"" → \""Pending\"".  When dealing with orders from other players, you can confirm the request and perform the craft by selecting \""Craft\"" → \""Crafting Requests\"" at your own My Room Terminal.  ※You can view this tutorial at any time by opening the main menu and selecting \""System\"" → \""Information\"" → \""Tutorials\""."""
