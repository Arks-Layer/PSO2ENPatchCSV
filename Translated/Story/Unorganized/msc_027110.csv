msc_027110_0050#0,"""That's right."""
msc_027110_0060#0,"""Let us talk about ARKS: the beings that we hold up as our ideal."""
msc_027110_0070#0,"""ARKS were the strongest soldiers who were renowned<br>for their victory during a great battle 1000 years ago."""
msc_027110_0080#0,"""Their efforts brought an end to an entire war."""
msc_027110_0090#0,"""In doing so, they brought about an era of peace."""
msc_027110_0100#0,"""At the same time, the powerful strength of the ARKS was<br>no longer needed, and thus they fell into obscurity..."""
msc_027110_0110#0,"""It was not until the Starless appeared that<br>they once again had everyone's attention."""
msc_027110_0120#0,"""We considered that, in order to combat this foreign<br>threat, we would need the strength of the ARKS of old."""
msc_027110_0130#0,"""However, the vast majority of information about<br>them had been unfortunately lost to history..."""
msc_027110_0140#0,"""What we were able to recover were fragments of combat data,<br>and the genetic information for a portion of ARKS..."""
msc_027110_0150#0,"""One such case of genetic information being taken<br>from an ARKS that had been placed in cold sleep."""
msc_027110_0160#0,"""Cold sleep?"""
msc_027110_0170#0,"""So, that means you found a former ARKS member<br>who was placed in suspended animation?"""
msc_027110_0180#0,"""Correct."""
msc_027110_0190#0,"""That being said, we were unable to learn any details about the individual."""
msc_027110_0200#0,"""...Why not?"""
msc_027110_0210#0,"""We were unable to deactivate their cryopreservation.<br>It has formidable protections."""
msc_027110_0220#0,"""With no other options, we put the matter of that ARKS<br>aside, and started pursuing other avenues of research."""
msc_027110_0230#0,"""We first started work on using genetic information to analyze factors relating to Photons."""
msc_027110_0240#0,"""Furthermore, using the recovered combat data, we carried out various simulations."""
msc_027110_0250#0,"""We used all of it as the basis for countless long-lasting experiments..."""
msc_027110_0260#0,"""The culmination of which... is you, 909."""
msc_027110_0270#0,"""We get the idea."""

msc_027110_0300#0,"""What happened to the people who lived in the city above us?"""
msc_027110_0310#0,"""...Hm."""
msc_027110_0320#0,"""In the earliest days, Resurgent ARKS<br>was comprised of roughly 100,000 people."""
msc_027110_0330#0,"""The majority of whom lived here."""
msc_027110_0340#0,"""Great minds collaborated, progressing the Creation of ARKS."""
msc_027110_0350#0,"""We referred to the first group of new ARKS by the name \""First Generation ARKS\""."""
msc_027110_0360#0,"""The experiments conducted on the First Generation<br>differed greatly from the later Generations."""
msc_027110_0370#0,"""We took the DNA from ancient ARKS and spliced<br>it directly into the bodies of test subjects."""
msc_027110_0380#0,"""...Directly?"""
msc_027110_0390#0,"""But if a huge amount of Photon information were to suddenly flow into a weaker body..."""
msc_027110_0400#0,"""Precisely."""
msc_027110_0410#0,"""With an ordinary body, the mind is unable to withstand the onslaught of Photons."""
msc_027110_0420#0,"""...Many of their bodies rejected it,<br>causing them to pass away."""
msc_027110_0430#0,"""Even those who survived the initial reaction eventually developed<br>physical and mental complications, and later dropped out of the experiment."""
msc_027110_0440#0,"""There was divided opinion amongst the research community."""
msc_027110_0450#0,"""The conflict didn't end at verbal back-and-forth;<br>it went as far as armed confrontations."""
msc_027110_0460#0,"""All the while, more people kept leaving the project.<br>At the end of it all, only 10% of the original community remained."""
msc_027110_0470#0,"""Yet another half of those personnel would eventually be lost<br>due to things like accidents during experimentation."""
msc_027110_0480#0,"""What few researchers remained progressed with the experiments,<br>and started on the development of Halpha."""
msc_027110_0490#0,"""All for the purpose of increasing the abilities of the<br>First Generation, who had acclimated to the ARKS genetics."""

msc_027110_0530#0,"""Using this power, I've been able to commandeer<br>countless different bodies over the centuries."""
msc_027110_0540#0,"""And, as the only one who knows firsthand the threat posed<br>by the Starless, I have been carrying out this experiment."""
