msc_023180_0020#0,"""So wait..."""
msc_023180_0030#0,"""We... We survived?"""
msc_023180_0040#0,"""ガヤ：アイナ隊モブアークス⑤"""
msc_023180_0050#0,"""Phew... We managed to fight our way out of there."""
msc_023180_0060#0,"""In front of the recruits, I put on a brave face and<br>just said everything will be alright, but deep down I was terrified."""
msc_023180_0070#0,"""I was like,<br>\""What if I make a mistake and someone gets injured?\""..."""
msc_023180_0080#0,"""I'm glad I was able to learn<br>so much from so many different leaders."""
msc_023180_0090#0,"""You did great."""
msc_023180_0100#0,"""You're a proper Instructor now."""
msc_023180_0110#0,"""Thanks..."""
msc_023180_0120#0,"""But that praise should be given to the recruits."""
msc_023180_0130#0,"""Nah..."""
msc_023180_0140#0,"""It's all because everyone worked together."""
msc_023180_0150#0,"""They really did great out there..."""
msc_023180_0160#0,"""Instructor Aina!"""
msc_023180_0170#0,"""Thank you so much!"""
msc_023180_0180#0,"""A-And also..."""
msc_023180_0190#0,"""I'm sorry!"""
msc_023180_0200#0,"""This all happened because of me..."""
msc_023180_0210#0,"""Nope. I didn't properly convey how strong<br>the enemies were going to be. It was my fault."""
msc_023180_0220#0,"""I should be the one to apologize,<br>for putting you all in danger like that."""
msc_023180_0230#0,"""Aw, Instructor..."""
msc_023180_0240#0,"""May I ask you something?"""
msc_023180_0250#0,"""Huh? What is it?"""
msc_023180_0260#0,"""How did you know about my leg?"""
msc_023180_0270#0,"""You injured it when you went out to train in secret, right?"""
msc_023180_0280#0,"""I keep an eye on my recruits, you know."""
msc_023180_0290#0,"""Well, what about my fighting style?"""
msc_023180_0300#0,"""You said I should fight by making<br>the enemy run towards me instead..."""
msc_023180_0310#0,"""It's easier for you to fight with a<br>bit of distance between you and your target, right?"""
msc_023180_0320#0,"""But you've always been charging towards your targets."""
msc_023180_0330#0,"""Er, right."""
msc_023180_0340#0,"""But I've only noticed that myself just recently..."""
msc_023180_0350#0,"""I'm not sure why, because I've always been<br>telling you to watch your distance."""
msc_023180_0360#0,"""Next time, trying a different kind of weapon<br>might not be a bad idea either, don't you think?"""
msc_023180_0370#0,"""I... I see..."""
msc_023180_0380#0,"""Umm... One more thing."""
msc_023180_0390#0,"""Why did you shoot up into the sky<br>during that fight back there?"""
msc_023180_0400#0,"""Oh, that?"""
msc_023180_0410#0,"""I wanted to signal our position."""
msc_023180_0420#0,"""I thought that, if <%me> was in the area,<br>they'd notice it immediately."""
msc_023180_0430#0,"""I knew as soon as I saw it."""
msc_023180_0440#0,"""I would've had trouble finding you if it weren't for that."""
msc_023180_0450#0,"""Well I'm glad I got the message across!"""
msc_023180_0460#0,"""Is that the \""power of a bond\"" thing?"""
msc_023180_0470#0,"""Hahaha... I think this might be a little bit different."""
msc_023180_0480#0,"""I'd say that was more of a general ability<br>to make a decision in the heat of battle."""
msc_023180_0490#0,"""But you two moved as though you knew each other's thoughts!"""
msc_023180_0500#0,"""You hadn't even coordinated a plan with each other beforehand,<br>and yet you moved without hesitation!"""
msc_023180_0510#0,"""That kind of blew me away as well."""
msc_023180_0520#0,"""So this is how the heroes who defeated Dark Falz fight together..."""
msc_023180_0530#0,"""We'll try our best to be able to fight like you two one day!"""
msc_023180_0540#0,"""Right, Luka?!"""
msc_023180_0550#0,"""...I-It's not like I intended on<br>pairing up with you forever, you know..."""
msc_023180_0560#0,"""Huh? A-Aw, don't be like that..."""
msc_023180_0570#0,"""Hehehe. Let's just get back to Aelio first, alright?"""
msc_023180_0580#0,"""Then we can all talk at leisure."""
