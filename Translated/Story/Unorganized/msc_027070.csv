msc_027070_0020#0,"""Apparently everyone moved out of here around the same time when the experiments on Halpha began."""
msc_027070_0030#0,"""The city's functions have been offline for a long time."""
msc_027070_0040#0,"""However, it seems like our mere arrival has caused a portion of those functions to boot back up."""
msc_027070_0050#0,"""And that's why enemies have started appearing?"""
msc_027070_0060#0,"""It appears to be a defense system for dealing with intruders."""
msc_027070_0070#0,"""I can also see errors in some of the training programs."""
msc_027070_0080#0,"""Is there a way to stop the enemies?"""
