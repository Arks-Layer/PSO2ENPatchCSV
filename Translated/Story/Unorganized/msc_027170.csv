msc_027170_0040#0,"""Just as Zephetto's consciousness was being<br>transferred into... um, the 4th clone's body..."""
msc_027170_0050#0,"""Something ended up seizing control of the body."""
msc_027170_0060#0,"""...As ever, things beyond our imagination just keep happening..."""

msc_027170_0090#0,"""I can't speak for long, but..."""
msc_027170_0100#0,"""Huh?"""
msc_027170_0110#0,"""I will at least tell you about what that \""something\"" was."""

msc_027170_0140#0,"""...It's me."""
msc_027170_0150#0,"""Zephetto?"""
msc_027170_0160#0,"""Right."""
msc_027170_0170#0,"""His name is Vael."""

msc_027170_0280#0,"""That's when they realized it."""
msc_027170_0290#0,"""They realized that what they were<br>eating contained far too few Photons."""
msc_027170_0300#0,"""At the same time, they realized the sheer abundance<br>of Photons of which the ancient ARKS were possessed."""
msc_027170_0310#0,"""That's when Vael decided to... just wait."""
msc_027170_0320#0,"""He figured all they had to do was wait for their prey<br>to get stronger; to fatten up on a buffet of Photons."""
msc_027170_0330#0,"""Vael then issued a command to all Starless."""
msc_027170_0340#0,"""Obeying his command, the Starless immediately stopped their attack,<br>departed into a separate dimension, and vanished from our region of space."""
