msc_023030_0020#0,"""Impeccable timing as always."""
msc_023030_0030#0,"""Have you anything to report on how Aina has been faring lately?"""
msc_023030_0040#0,"""She's the same as she's always been."""
msc_023030_0050#0,"""She seems less energetic."""
msc_023030_0060#0,"""...I see. Well, I certainly hope so."""
msc_023030_0070#0,"""As I thought, she's still hesitant to the idea..."""
msc_023030_0080#0,"""I think I already mentioned this, but I'm having Aina act as the instructor for a newly formed team of trainees."""
msc_023030_0090#0,"""This will be her first time being the teacher rather than the student."""
msc_023030_0100#0,"""She likely feels no small amount of anxiety about the situation."""
msc_023030_0110#0,"""Currently, I planned to supervise the training drills myself, but..."""

msc_023030_0180#0,"""That's why I couldn't be more thankful to count Aina among their number."""
msc_023030_0190#0,"""She has the ability to inspire people."""
msc_023030_0200#0,"""Not to mention the experience of countless battles."""
msc_023030_0210#0,"""I believe Aina would make a good leader."""
msc_023030_0220#0,"""Not too long ago she struggled to even operate a Rifle. Her progress is genuinely astonishing."""
msc_023030_0230#0,"""It is that experience of hers that I would like to see instilled in the next generation of ARKS."""
msc_023030_0240#0,"""At any rate, we'll have to wait and see how things go from here."""
