msn_023022_0020#0,"""I'm Quilla. My hobby is to uncover the mysteries of Halpha."""
msn_023022_0030#0,"""Actually, after the Lecielans showed up, most of those mysteries got spoiled for people like me..."""

msn_023022_0050#0,"""That's why I wanted to ask for your help, you being the Guardian and all."""
msn_023022_0060#0,"""Currently, I'm particularly interested in the Sagaan Mountain Pass, in the west part of Retem."""

msn_023022_0080#0,"""Alright, thanks for helping!"""
msn_023022_0110#0,"""Could you go to Sagaan Mountain Pass first? I'll explain everything when you get there."""
msn_023022_0120#0,"""Alright. Thanks again!"""
msn_023022_0210#0,"""There's one more mystery! Next, I want you to go to Mistra Forest!"""
