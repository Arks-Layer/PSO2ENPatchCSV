msn_023026_0020#0,"""...You're studying this crystal formation?"""
msn_023026_0030#0,"""This is the crystallized form of Photonsol, the tissue that DOLLS are mainly comprised of."""
msn_023026_0040#0,"""In Halpha, deceased lifeforms are decomposed by way of nanomachines."""
msn_023026_0050#0,"""However, due to various external factors, the nanomachines don't always function correctly."""
msn_023026_0060#0,"""Remnants of DOLLS tissue that was unable to be decomposed tends to accumulate and crystallize like so."""
msn_023026_0070#0,"""Photonsol turns red during overclocking, and by extention, so do DOLLS."""
msn_023026_0080#0,"""It's safe to say that this crystal formation also turns red in response to heightened Photon density levels in the air."""

msn_023026_0140#0,"""You know, that big planet that's always in the same place in the sky no matter when you look up there?"""
msn_023026_0150#0,"""I was just wondering what kind of place it is."""
msn_023026_0160#0,"""We do not know about anything that exists beyond Halpha."""

msn_023026_0180#0,"""Well hey, that must mean that there's also things about Halpha that they haven't investigated yet."""
msn_023026_0190#0,"""There's gotta be something we can find somewhere around here."""
msn_023026_0200#0,"""Thanks so much, Guardian! If something else comes up, you'll help me again, right?"""
