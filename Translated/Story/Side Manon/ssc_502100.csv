ssc_502100_0020#0,"""Ahhh, so it was you..."""
ssc_502100_0030#0,"""You seem troubled..."""
ssc_502100_0040#0,"""What's the matter?"""
ssc_502100_0050#0,"""Oh. No..."""
ssc_502100_0060#0,"""No, it's nothing..."""
ssc_502100_0070#0,"""..."""
ssc_502100_0080#0,"""When I come here,<br>I can't help but be reminded."""
ssc_502100_0090#0,"""Of our fight with Nilus Stia..."""
ssc_502100_0100#0,"""And how that one<br>soldier gave his life..."""
ssc_502100_0110#0,"""...to protect someone like me..."""
ssc_502100_0120#0,"""Why...?"""
ssc_502100_0130#0,"""Don't blame yourself."""
ssc_502100_0140#0,"""That was his duty."""
ssc_502100_0150#0,"""But...!"""
ssc_502100_0160#0,"""His duty... was to protect us?"""
ssc_502100_0170#0,"""He had a life too, <%me>."""
ssc_502100_0180#0,"""He probably had so many things he wanted to do.<br>Dreams he wanted to fulfill."""
ssc_502100_0190#0,"""And I... took all of that<br>away from him... forever..."""
ssc_502100_0200#0,"""I cannot approve of<br>that line of thinking."""
ssc_502100_0210#0,"""Kanui?!"""
ssc_502100_0220#0,"""My apologies. I heard<br>some voices over here."""
ssc_502100_0230#0,"""May I speak about the<br>Stia vanguard for a moment?"""
ssc_502100_0240#0,"""One of our rules is to<br>\""Never abandon your allies\""."""
ssc_502100_0250#0,"""In battle, enemies aren't<br>the most terrifying thing."""
ssc_502100_0260#0,"""Being unable to trust your<br>own comrades is far more terrifying."""
ssc_502100_0270#0,"""The thought of possibly being left behind<br>if you get isolated or injured in battle."""
ssc_502100_0280#0,"""Worries like that would constantly haunt<br>you if you didn't trust your comrades."""
ssc_502100_0290#0,"""That rule was made in an<br>effort to eradicate that fear."""
ssc_502100_0300#0,"""The troops can depend on<br>one another without worry."""
ssc_502100_0310#0,"""We build up mutual trust,<br>and we carry out our mission."""
ssc_502100_0320#0,"""The soldier who protected you<br>was merely following that rule."""
ssc_502100_0330#0,"""He saw you in danger and made<br>the decision. \""Don't abandon her\""."""
ssc_502100_0340#0,"""\""More people will survive if she lives.\"""""
ssc_502100_0350#0,"""I believe that's what he was thinking."""
ssc_502100_0360#0,"""And then, the battle progressed as it did."""
ssc_502100_0370#0,"""...No! All I did was let<br>my anger take over, and then...!"""
ssc_502100_0380#0,"""In battle, results are everything."""
ssc_502100_0390#0,"""Of course, the process is important,<br>but our concern at the end of the day is thus:"""
ssc_502100_0400#0,"""\""How many enemies were defeated,<br>and how many allies survived?\"""""
ssc_502100_0410#0,"""If many people have to give their lives, the one<br>who has to bear that burden is Commander Guren."""
ssc_502100_0420#0,"""And of course, so<br>do I, as Adjutant."""
ssc_502100_0430#0,"""That soldier simply<br>did what he had to do."""
ssc_502100_0440#0,"""So please, stand tall and<br>look towards the future."""
ssc_502100_0450#0,"""Kanui..."""
ssc_502100_0460#0,"""That is all I have to say."""
ssc_502100_0470#0,"""...Thank you."""
ssc_502100_0480#0,"""Not at all. I was merely intruding<br>on your conversation."""
ssc_502100_0490#0,"""I'll be returning to my<br>mission out here. Farewell."""
ssc_502100_0500#0,"""...It's going to be hard<br>to sort out these feelings..."""
ssc_502100_0510#0,"""But Kanui's right. I have to try<br>moving forward beyond this."""
ssc_502100_0520#0,"""Not least of all for that ARKS who...<br>sacrificed his future for me."""
