ssc_502090_0020#0,"""Got errands at the camp?"""
ssc_502090_0030#0,"""Heading inside?"""
ssc_502090_0040#0,"""No. Just sightseeing."""
ssc_502090_0050#0,"""No, I'm not here for<br>any particular reason."""
ssc_502090_0060#0,"""The ARKS of Stia are just<br>as busy as ever, aren't they?"""
ssc_502090_0070#0,"""They were able to improve<br>their numbers and resources, though."""
ssc_502090_0080#0,"""Since their scope of activity extended<br>farther into Stia, they have that much more to do."""
ssc_502090_0090#0,"""But not a single one of<br>them have been complaining."""
ssc_502090_0100#0,"""Everyone has their own duties and<br>obligations, and it's kept morale high."""
ssc_502090_0110#0,"""I've seen something like this before..."""
ssc_502090_0120#0,"""You mean in the other regions?"""
ssc_502090_0130#0,"""...You mean Aelio Town?"""
ssc_502090_0140#0,"""There is that. ARKS in every region<br>are all similarly trying their best."""
ssc_502090_0150#0,"""But what I'm reminded most of<br>is everyone back in Aelio Town..."""
ssc_502090_0160#0,"""Indeed..."""
ssc_502090_0170#0,"""Aelio Town single-handedly undertook<br>defense of Aelio's \""fringes\""."""

ssc_502090_0190#0,"""But, as you know, there<br>weren't many ARKS in Aelio Town."""
ssc_502090_0200#0,"""They made do with a small scouting party, maintained<br>their own equipment, gathered their own food..."""
ssc_502090_0210#0,"""They were busy working,<br>all day every day."""
ssc_502090_0220#0,"""All while never knowing<br>when DOLLS might attack them."""
ssc_502090_0230#0,"""When they were attacked at night,<br>they'd pull all-nighters in order to deal with it."""
ssc_502090_0240#0,"""Even in a situation like that, nobody<br>complained. Nobody was discontent."""
ssc_502090_0250#0,"""In fact, they rather<br>enjoyed their daily life..."""
ssc_502090_0260#0,"""They were all carrying out their duties,<br>though at the time I didn't know it."""
ssc_502090_0270#0,"""That's why I always try so hard now..."""
ssc_502090_0280#0,"""They all single-mindedly<br>dreamt of a peaceful life..."""

ssc_502090_0300#0,"""Seeing the ARKS of Stia<br>just reminded me all over again."""
ssc_502090_0310#0,"""...Sorry. I went on a bit of a ramble there."""
ssc_502090_0320#0,"""So much has happened since then,<br>so I can't help but think about it."""
ssc_502090_0330#0,"""About our journey up until now...<br>And about the journey ahead of us..."""
ssc_502090_0340#0,"""I'm going try sorting out<br>my feelings for a bit longer."""
