ssc_502080_0010#0,"""Somehow I had a feeling<br>you'd show up here."""
ssc_502080_0020#0,"""It's always times like this<br>when you sneak up on me and give me a fright."""
ssc_502080_0030#0,"""...Ahem. Anyways, have you also<br>taken an interest in this place?"""
ssc_502080_0040#0,"""You mean Bergana Ruins?"""
ssc_502080_0050#0,"""They say a lot of people used to live here."""
ssc_502080_0060#0,"""Indeed..."""
ssc_502080_0070#0,"""Oh, you knew?<br>I wonder who told you that."""
ssc_502080_0080#0,"""Rysas had gathered documents<br>about this place as well."""
ssc_502080_0090#0,"""Apparently the name \""Bergana Ruins\""<br>was given to it by the people of Kvaris."""
ssc_502080_0100#0,"""Originally found as a relatively large collection of ancient ruins,<br>they repaired it, turning it into a livable habitat once more."""
ssc_502080_0110#0,"""It's been said that only Lost Central--"""
ssc_502080_0120#0,"""Only the former Central City had<br>a larger population than they did."""
ssc_502080_0130#0,"""Alas, one hundred years ago,<br>it once again fell to \""ruins\""."""
ssc_502080_0140#0,"""Back then, Kvaris was far more technologically<br>advanced than even today's Aelio or Retem."""
ssc_502080_0150#0,"""It seems that they even had, rare as they are today,<br>vehicles made for personal use on a daily basis."""
ssc_502080_0160#0,"""In addition, they were being actively<br>utilized to fight against the DOLLS."""
ssc_502080_0170#0,"""Similarly, their weapon manufacturing had been flourishing,<br>resulting in an equally powerful military force."""
ssc_502080_0180#0,"""Even with all that, they were hardly<br>any match for a serious offensive from the DOLLS."""
ssc_502080_0190#0,"""The cause:<br>the ARKS themselves lacked strength."""
ssc_502080_0200#0,"""Due to an over-dependence on powerful weapons,<br>the ARKS neglected their natural strengths."""
ssc_502080_0210#0,"""The natural strength of all ARKS:<br>The power of Photons."""
ssc_502080_0220#0,"""It doesn't matter how strong your weapons are<br>if you lack the ammunition and energy to make use of them."""
ssc_502080_0230#0,"""And our last line of defense: our quantity of<br>inner Photons, and our ability to manipulate them."""
ssc_502080_0240#0,"""The ARKS of Kvaris weren't able to<br>manifest this power... so they lost."""
ssc_502080_0250#0,"""... Words like those were recorded<br>within Rysas' documentation."""
ssc_502080_0260#0,"""I've only seen a small portion of his documents,<br>but there were many such references to war."""
ssc_502080_0270#0,"""He wasn't just a passionate researcher, he was<br>an all-around outstanding ARKS in his own right."""
ssc_502080_0280#0,"""This fundamental power of ARKS surpasses<br>both weapon strength and scientific ability."""
ssc_502080_0290#0,"""It's similar to how the ARKS of Retem think."""
ssc_502080_0300#0,"""The Aelio and Retem of today<br>lack the technology of ancient Kvaris."""
ssc_502080_0310#0,"""For example, even if we could develop their advanced technology,<br>we can't mass-produce it like they could."""
ssc_502080_0320#0,"""Because of that, we can't build a system<br>that relies on powerful weapons."""
ssc_502080_0330#0,"""And so, all we can do is<br>become stronger ourselves."""
ssc_502080_0340#0,"""... Inevitably, that's what it all boils down to."""
