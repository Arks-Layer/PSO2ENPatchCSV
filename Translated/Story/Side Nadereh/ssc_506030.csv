ssc_506030_0030#0,"""If it's all the same to you, could you stay here<br>and listen to me talk for a bit?"""
ssc_506030_0040#0,"""...It was a long battle."""
ssc_506030_0050#0,"""It's far from being over, but we did manage<br>to get a single moment of pause."""
ssc_506030_0060#0,"""In this endless battle<br>against \""Lenus Retem\""."""
ssc_506030_0070#0,"""Just a single pause costed us<br>this many sacrifices."""
ssc_506030_0080#0,"""If we weren't able to get help from all of you;<br>if we just kept fighting as we were..."""
ssc_506030_0090#0,"""We would've likely lost in the end."""
ssc_506030_0100#0,"""Us people of Retem have always resolved all of<br>our problems with our own strength."""
ssc_506030_0110#0,"""We built our own fully self-sufficient society,<br>never asking outsiders for help."""
ssc_506030_0120#0,"""It was something of a<br>point of pride for us."""
ssc_506030_0130#0,"""Sand-covered dunes."""
ssc_506030_0140#0,"""A mountain border."""
ssc_506030_0150#0,"""Our perspective must have become narrowed<br>by living in such an isolated world."""
ssc_506030_0160#0,"""When you and the girls first came to this land,<br>many of us looked at you with a skeptical eye."""
ssc_506030_0170#0,"""Some people even said there was nothing more shameful<br>than getting bailed out by Aelio."""
ssc_506030_0180#0,"""Part of the reason I first rejected your aid<br>was because of the opinions of those people."""
ssc_506030_0190#0,"""Thinking back on it now,<br>it was all just foolish pride."""
ssc_506030_0200#0,"""The people who made me<br>realize that were you three."""
ssc_506030_0210#0,"""In unfamiliar lands, you all took the initiative to act, and you produced results."""
ssc_506030_0220#0,"""That sight changed the<br>minds of Jalil and Mohsen."""
ssc_506030_0230#0,"""And with them,<br>mine as well."""
ssc_506030_0240#0,"""Once again,<br>let me give you my thanks."""

ssc_506030_0330#0,"""We're here today precisely because<br>our predecessors fought so hard."""
ssc_506030_0340#0,"""And, in the end,<br>we achieved victory."""
ssc_506030_0350#0,"""Not a single one of<br>them died in vain."""

ssc_506030_0380#0,"""How did Manon know the words<br>to the \""Song of Mourning\""?"""
ssc_506030_0390#0,"""... I don't know."""
ssc_506030_0400#0,"""She does a lot of research and studying."""
ssc_506030_0410#0,"""I see..."""
ssc_506030_0420#0,"""I want to ask her herself,<br>but it's quite a special song."""

ssc_506030_0450#0,"""But it's also a song<br>known to many peoples."""
ssc_506030_0460#0,"""It wouldn't be unusual if she<br>had heard it somewhere before in the past."""
ssc_506030_0470#0,"""...Well, I've taken up enough of your time.<br>Let's save that talk for later."""
ssc_506030_0480#0,"""If you don't mind,<br>let's pay our respects together."""
