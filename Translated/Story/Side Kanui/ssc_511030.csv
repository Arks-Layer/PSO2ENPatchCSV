ssc_511030_0020#0,"""What are you doing<br>all the way out here?"""
ssc_511030_0030#0,"""Just checking out the situation."""
ssc_511030_0040#0,"""What about you?"""
ssc_511030_0050#0,"""Your continued assistance with<br>the war effort is most appreciated."""
ssc_511030_0060#0,"""We wouldn't be capable of full<br>coverage of Stia with our numbers alone."""
ssc_511030_0070#0,"""I'm currently on patrol duty."""
ssc_511030_0080#0,"""Many enemies yet remain<br>all throughout Stia."""
ssc_511030_0090#0,"""Considerably powerful enemies continue to lurk in this area in particular."""
ssc_511030_0100#0,"""Certainly a perilous place<br>for any inexperienced ARKS."""
ssc_511030_0110#0,"""...Still, I never would've thought<br>such a gigantic structure was down here..."""
ssc_511030_0120#0,"""I was shocked as well."""
ssc_511030_0130#0,"""Did you know something was down here?"""
ssc_511030_0140#0,"""So Crawford didn't give you an explanation in advance?"""
ssc_511030_0150#0,"""I see... Perhaps he wasn't sure if<br>his information was reliable."""
ssc_511030_0160#0,"""No, we weren't aware of it until<br>Crawford brought us the information."""
ssc_511030_0170#0,"""This place was just our final<br>objective, as it was yours."""
ssc_511030_0180#0,"""However, our goal was merely<br>to gain control of the area."""
ssc_511030_0190#0,"""We figured a strong enemy was lurking here,<br>but we never expected it to be Dark Falz."""
ssc_511030_0200#0,"""If we had stormed into that place without your support,<br>there's no telling what could've happened..."""
ssc_511030_0210#0,"""Ah, speaking of which, I haven't mentioned this yet."""
ssc_511030_0220#0,"""While inside the central region, our investigation team<br>found some data regarding Dark Falz."""
ssc_511030_0230#0,"""According to the reports, apparently Dark Falz was<br>collecting combat data from all throughout Halpha."""
ssc_511030_0240#0,"""...Of its own volition?"""
ssc_511030_0250#0,"""...On someone's orders?"""
ssc_511030_0260#0,"""That... we do not know."""
ssc_511030_0270#0,"""That raises the question of<br<\""If so, then on whose orders?\"""""
ssc_511030_0280#0,"""The details are unclear, but..."""
ssc_511030_0290#0,"""There is little doubt that<br>Dark Falz has been studying how ARKS fight."""
ssc_511030_0300#0,"""If left unattended, he could become<br>an even more formidable apponent."""
ssc_511030_0310#0,"""Perhaps I should say that it's a<br>good thing we got to it now and not later..."""
ssc_511030_0320#0,"""I will relay this information<br>to Crawford as well."""
ssc_511030_0330#0,"""I'm sure he will be able<br>to find a solution."""
ssc_511030_0340#0,"""It will take some time, but we intend to<br>continue our investigations in this area."""
ssc_511030_0350#0,"""...Ah, my apologies. This has become<br>a rather long conversation."""
ssc_511030_0360#0,"""I shall return to my mission."""
ssc_511030_0370#0,"""May we meet again soon."""
