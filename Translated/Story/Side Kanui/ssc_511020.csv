ssc_511020_0010#0,"""Oh? Greetings."""
ssc_511020_0020#0,"""Ah, yes. While you're here,<br>please let me ask you something."""
ssc_511020_0030#0,"""...When you first laid eyes upon<br>this place, what were your thoughts?"""
ssc_511020_0040#0,"""I was shocked."""
ssc_511020_0050#0,"""It reminded me of another area."""
ssc_511020_0060#0,"""Indeed, as it should.<br>I was much the same."""
ssc_511020_0070#0,"""I see. I suspect that area<br>would be Retem's Lower Maqaad?"""
ssc_511020_0080#0,"""Commander Guren was the one who led<br>the scouting party that discovered this place."""
ssc_511020_0090#0,"""I was also among that party."""
ssc_511020_0100#0,"""\""The DOLLS don't come from the sky.<br>They're created somewhere here on Halpha.\"""""
ssc_511020_0110#0,"""Those were words<br>left behind by Hibana..."""
ssc_511020_0120#0,"""I didn't think it would<br>appear before me like this."""
ssc_511020_0130#0,"""The Commander initially formed the Stia Vanguard<br>with the primary goal of taking this facility over."""
ssc_511020_0140#0,"""...By the way, did Crawford mention anything<br>about this area before you arrived?"""
ssc_511020_0150#0,"""Crawford didn't mention anything."""
ssc_511020_0160#0,"""They... didn't really stay in touch."""
ssc_511020_0170#0,"""I see..."""
ssc_511020_0180#0,"""Perhaps he thought it'd be quicker<br>if you simply saw it for yourselves."""
ssc_511020_0190#0,"""O-Oh... I see."""
ssc_511020_0200#0,"""I was rather surprised by the<br>sudden call from him back then..."""
ssc_511020_0210#0,"""Anyways, we unfortunately haven't really made<br>an effort to explore this place more thoroughly."""
ssc_511020_0220#0,"""What we do know is that<br>this place is a power plant."""
ssc_511020_0230#0,"""It appears to power the plant's core systems,<br>along with a DOLLS production line."""
ssc_511020_0240#0,"""The power plant's energy is<br>supplied throughout all areas of Halpha."""
ssc_511020_0250#0,"""Carelessly destryoing the production line<br>could possibly affect the entire system."""
ssc_511020_0260#0,"""...And that's about it."""
ssc_511020_0270#0,"""We will continue investigating, and begin<br>analysis on the system's framework..."""
ssc_511020_0280#0,"""With hopes to gradually shut down<br>the plant in slow increments."""
ssc_511020_0290#0,"""That is our plan, at least."""
ssc_511020_0300#0,"""With engineers and researchers from Aelio visiting us soon,<br>we should finally be able to make some real progress."""
ssc_511020_0310#0,"""At first, we thought it would be fine to simply<br>destroy any DOLLS installments we came across."""
ssc_511020_0320#0,"""Alas, things never seem to be that easy."""
ssc_511020_0330#0,"""That's why it's going to take a bit more time to<br>fully wrest control of Stia, this plant included."""
ssc_511020_0340#0,"""Until such a time as completion of our mission,<br>we'd greatly appreciate any help you could offer."""
ssc_511020_0350#0,"""I look forward to working with you."""
