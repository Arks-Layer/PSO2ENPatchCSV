ssc_511010_0020#0,"""Most of the enemies have been cleared out, but don't let your guard down."""
ssc_511010_0030#0,"""...Actually, do you have a moment to talk?"""
ssc_511010_0040#0,"""Thank you very much."""
ssc_511010_0050#0,"""I have a question, you see...<br>It's about Commander Guren."""
ssc_511010_0060#0,"""Tell me honestly, what do you think of him?"""
ssc_511010_0070#0,"""He's strong."""
ssc_511010_0080#0,"""He's scary."""
ssc_511010_0090#0,"""What? Well, yes... He is certainly strong. Moreso than any other ARKS."""
ssc_511010_0100#0,"""Though that wasn't quite the answer I was looking for..."""
ssc_511010_0110#0,"""...So he really does give off that impression."""
ssc_511010_0120#0,"""The Commander is not very well spoken, so<br>there've been more than a few misunderstandings."""
ssc_511010_0130#0,"""Even moreso while under the<br>pressure of mobilizing a strategy."""
ssc_511010_0140#0,"""However, he really does<br>care for his subordinates."""
ssc_511010_0150#0,"""In enemy territory,<br>he always takes point..."""
ssc_511010_0160#0,"""When falling back,<br>he is the last to retreat."""
ssc_511010_0170#0,"""I believe it is his way of<br>ensuring as few losses as possible."""
ssc_511010_0180#0,"""It's because of that disposition that<br>his subordinates hold such trust in him."""
ssc_511010_0190#0,"""I won't hesitate to say that we put our<br>lives on the line because we know our Commander has our back."""
ssc_511010_0200#0,"""That being said, there are certain times where<br>I wish the Commander made himself more approachable."""
ssc_511010_0210#0,"""Particularly regarding<br>first impressions..."""
ssc_511010_0220#0,"""Earlier, I heard an Aelio Supply Corps<br>member's impression of the Commander."""
ssc_511010_0230#0,"""She said \""It felt like I was going to die if I did anything to upset him.\"""""
ssc_511010_0240#0,"""She spoke casually to everyone, but was<br>strangely formal when speaking to the Commander..."""
ssc_511010_0250#0,"""So I figured<br>something was off..."""
ssc_511010_0260#0,"""I'm glad I was able to figure it out<br>before it led to a bigger misunderstanding."""
ssc_511010_0270#0,"""She sounds kind of familiar."""
ssc_511010_0280#0,"""Who did you hear this from?"""
ssc_511010_0290#0,"""Her name was Xitrae."""
ssc_511010_0300#0,"""A woman named Xitrae."""
ssc_511010_0310#0,"""If you are familiar with her, please make sure<br>she understands when you see her next."""
ssc_511010_0320#0,"""The Commander isn't scary. He is just a quiet man<br>who isn't very good at displaying his emotions."""
ssc_511010_0330#0,"""You are one of the few ARKS whom<br>the Commander openly approves of."""
ssc_511010_0340#0,"""I would like to speak with<br>you in person more often."""
ssc_511010_0350#0,"""It has been a pleasure."""
