msc_010230_0020#0,"""I am..."""
msc_010230_0030#0,"""Manon, right?"""
msc_010230_0040#0,"""I heard tell of your arrival."""
msc_010230_0050#0,"""...You've been through something that no person should ever have to go through."""
msc_010230_0060#0,"""It's good to see that you two are, at least<br>physically, uninjured after such a tragedy."""
msc_010230_0070#0,"""Listen, um... Where's Aina?"""
msc_010230_0080#0,"""Right now, she's being treated in the Medical Center."""
msc_010230_0090#0,"""You needn't worry. Her life isn't in danger."""
msc_010230_0100#0,"""She was admitted... around 12 hours ago.<br>In fact, she should be getting out any moment now."""
msc_010230_0110#0,"""Aina, are you alright?"""
msc_010230_0120#0,"""...Hehe. I'm fine, I'm fine."""
msc_010230_0130#0,"""Do take it easy, though, yes?"""
msc_010230_0140#0,"""Thanks, Crawford."""
msc_010230_0150#0,"""And thanks to you two, as well."""
msc_010230_0160#0,"""Hm? For what?"""
msc_010230_0170#0,"""Well, for worrying about me. I'm happy that you do."""
msc_010230_0180#0,"""And... is my Dad...?"""
msc_010230_0190#0,"""...I see."""
msc_010230_0200#0,"""This DOLL that even my Dad was no match for... What is it?"""
msc_010230_0210#0,"""The details are currently being investigated, but..."""
msc_010230_0220#0,"""It is our assumption that a species of DOLLS known as Dark Falz exists."""
msc_010230_0230#0,"""It's speculated that Dark Falz was the cause of a calamity<br>that brought about untold devastation around 100 years ago."""
msc_010230_0240#0,"""Some say that the capital city at the time was instantly wiped off the map."""
msc_010230_0250#0,"""If the DOLL you encountered was indeed this Dark Falz..."""
msc_010230_0260#0,"""Then we have no time to lose. We must plan and act<br>under the full expectation that this will happen again."""
msc_010230_0270#0,"""Which leads me..."""
msc_010230_0280#0,"""Leads you to... what?"""
msc_010230_0290#0,"""As literally the only people who have personally encountered Dark Falz,<br>it would be irresponsible of me to not ask you to join us in this fight."""
msc_010230_0300#0,"""Though it may be cruel of me to ask this so soon after<br>what you've been through... Your aid would be invaluable to us."""
msc_010230_0310#0,"""I will... fight. No, I WANT to fight Dark Falz."""
msc_010230_0320#0,"""So that sort of thing... never... happens to anyone else."""
msc_010230_0330#0,"""Aina..."""
msc_010230_0340#0,"""What about you two?"""
msc_010230_0350#0,"""I'll fight too."""
msc_010230_0360#0,"""What will you do, Manon?"""
msc_010230_0370#0,"""...Really?"""
msc_010230_0380#0,"""You are yet new and unfamiliar to this world, are<br>you not? You don't have to answer right away."""
msc_010230_0390#0,"""I... I'll..."""
msc_010230_0400#0,"""...Alright. I'll help too."""
msc_010230_0410#0,"""I see... You have my thanks."""
msc_010230_0420#0,"""I'll... join you."""
msc_010230_0430#0,"""...Manon..."""
msc_010230_0440#0,"""All three of you have my thanks."""
msc_010230_0450#0,"""So, what should we do?"""
msc_010230_0460#0,"""First, I'd like you to help with preparations for intercepting Dark Falz."""
msc_010230_0470#0,"""...And, should Dark Falz appear... """
msc_010230_0480#0,"""Fight it together."""
msc_010230_0500#0,"""Of course, you needn't start right away. Ran, the lodging preparations?"""
msc_010230_0510#0,"""I've secured rooms for three people."""
msc_010230_0520#0,"""From now on, you three are residents of Central City."""
msc_010230_0530#0,"""If each of you check your Mags, you will also notice<br>that you've been registered as licensed ARKS members."""
msc_010230_0540#0,"""Your Mags will also serve as keys to your respective<br>rooms, so make sure to rest whenever you need to."""
msc_010230_0550#0,"""...Anything else I have to say can wait for another day."""
msc_010230_0560#0,"""I've sent the location of your rooms to your Mags.<br>Today, the only thing I'd like you to do is rest."""
