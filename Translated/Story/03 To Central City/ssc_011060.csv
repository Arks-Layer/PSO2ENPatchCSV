ssc_011060_0030#0,"""As you just heard, we've detected a strong DOLLS energy signal. Their targets appear to be the ARKS Mining Rigs."""
ssc_011060_0040#0,"""As the name suggests, they are a type of heavy machinery that we use to excavate resources from underground."""
ssc_011060_0050#0,"""These excavated resources are necessary for City maintenance as well as the manufacturing of issued ARKS equipment."""
ssc_011060_0055#0,"""Without these resources, we will not be able to continue fighting the DOLLS."""
ssc_011060_0060#0,"""Radar equipment is being operated to anticipate DOLLS movement, but it's not uncommon for the radars themselves to draw their attention in the same way."""
ssc_011060_0070#0,"""The rigs are being escorted by way of resource convoy, but this is a large-scale offensive, so we anticipate a grueling battle."""
ssc_011060_0080#0,"""I'd like you to participate in this defensive battle. Please lend whatever aid you can. Thank you, and best of luck."""
