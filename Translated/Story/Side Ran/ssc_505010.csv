ssc_505010_0010#0,"""Oh? Is that you, <%me>?"""
ssc_505010_0020#0,"""It feels strange to meet you<br>outside of the Command Room."""
ssc_505010_0030#0,"""What are you doing?"""
ssc_505010_0040#0,"""Are you on some mission?"""
ssc_505010_0050#0,"""Just going for a walk. I just got finished overseeing a mission."""
ssc_505010_0060#0,"""Quite the opposite, I actually just got finished overseeing one. I'm on break at the moment."""
ssc_505010_0070#0,"""Crawford told me to take breaks when I can<br>so I don't overexert myself."""
ssc_505010_0080#0,"""Though, Crawford's the one who<br>should be taking a break if anyone."""
ssc_505010_0090#0,"""On top of being a battle commander, he also has to manage Central City."""
ssc_505010_0100#0,"""I also often see him personally advising ARKS members when he can."""
ssc_505010_0110#0,"""It makes you wonder when he ever sleeps, but he never seems to look tired at all."""
ssc_505010_0120#0,"""He's amazing."""
ssc_505010_0130#0,"""He's so cool."""
ssc_505010_0140#0,"""Yeah. He's a really dependable leader."""
ssc_505010_0150#0,"""At first glance he looks like an<br>unreliable older brother, though. Hehehe."""
ssc_505010_0160#0,"""He seems to be really popular<br>with certain groups of ARKS."""
ssc_505010_0170#0,"""I don't think he really likes<br>the attention though. Hehehe."""
ssc_505010_0180#0,"""Honestly, I was so nervous when<br>I first started out as an Operator."""
ssc_505010_0190#0,"""The thought that people's lives<br>depend on me not making any mistakes..."""
ssc_505010_0200#0,"""But at that moment, Crawford would look at me with a smile."""
ssc_505010_0210#0,"""He'd say \""If it ever looks like you're about to<br>make a mistake, I'll support you every step of the way.\"""""
ssc_505010_0220#0,"""And \""The other Operators are there with you. You have nothing to be worried about.\"""""
ssc_505010_0230#0,"""After that, I started to gain a bit of confidence, and<br>became able to actively talk to Rossa and the other girls."""
ssc_505010_0240#0,"""I didn't realize how much I needed<br>to hear those words. It really helped me."""
ssc_505010_0250#0,"""...Oh, I'm sorry.<br>Listen to me ramble on."""
ssc_505010_0260#0,"""I should probably get back..."""
ssc_505010_0270#0,"""...Oh, and keep this talk<br>a secret from Crawford, okay?"""
ssc_505010_0280#0,"""Good luck in your missions, <%me>."""
ssc_505010_0290#0,"""Also, when you next visit Crawford, I'd be happy<br>if you told him \""You're overexerting yourself!\"""""
ssc_505010_0300#0,"""Bye now."""
