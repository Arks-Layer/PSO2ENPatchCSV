ssc_505020_0010#0,"""Mmmm, yeah... when you're looking out from up here,<br>it doesn't really sink in."""
ssc_505020_0020#0,"""Oh, <%me>!<br>It's good to see you."""
ssc_505020_0030#0,"""Taking  break?"""
ssc_505020_0040#0,"""What's up?"""
ssc_505020_0050#0,"""No, I'm on a job...<br>but also kind of taking a break."""
ssc_505020_0060#0,"""I went outside for<br>a change of pace."""
ssc_505020_0070#0,"""I just thought I'd come out<br>to get some fresh air."""
ssc_505020_0080#0,"""It gets a little stuffy being in<br>the Command Room all the time."""
ssc_505020_0090#0,"""Ah, right."""
ssc_505020_0100#0,"""I was just assembling all of the data from<br>the expeditions in the Kvaris region, but..."""
ssc_505020_0110#0,"""Would you like to<br>hear about it?"""
ssc_505020_0120#0,"""Alright, I'll start."""
ssc_505020_0130#0,"""Presently, Kvaris is a snow-covered,<br>cold environment."""
ssc_505020_0140#0,"""However, it's been recorded that it<br>was once a temperate, verdant land."""
ssc_505020_0150#0,"""It was once similar to<br>how Aelio is today."""
ssc_505020_0160#0,"""In those days, many people had lived and prospered<br>in Kvaris--even moreso than the Aelio and Retem of today."""
ssc_505020_0170#0,"""Unfortunately, Dark Falz attacked, and it<br>became like that over the course of a single night..."""
ssc_505020_0180#0,"""Well, maybe \""a single night\"" is an exaggeration,<br>but there's no doubt the climate changed very rapidly."""
ssc_505020_0190#0,"""We're still sorely lacking in data<br>about what exactly caused this to happen."""
ssc_505020_0200#0,"""Though Dark Falz himself had disappeared,<br>Kvaris residents were nevertheless forced to evacuate..."""
ssc_505020_0210#0,"""Many fled to Aelio, and would<br>go on to build this Central City."""
ssc_505020_0220#0,"""It's also said that a portion<br>of evacuees moved to Retem."""
ssc_505020_0230#0,"""Ever since, Kvaris has<br>remained practically uninhabited."""
ssc_505020_0240#0,"""The extended-period vanguard team we sent to Kvaris<br>was the largest of such operations to date."""
ssc_505020_0250#0,"""For a long time, both Aelio and Retem have had<br>their hands full protecting their own regions..."""
ssc_505020_0260#0,"""Thanks to the efforts of all of you, however,<br>we were finally able to expand into Kvaris."""
ssc_505020_0270#0,"""We can't thank you enough."""
ssc_505020_0280#0,"""As for current developments within Kvaris, I think<br>the vanguard members themselves would have all the details."""
ssc_505020_0290#0,"""Please ask around when you<br>next pay them a visit."""
ssc_505020_0300#0,"""If I didn't have this job as an Operator,<br>I would've liked to volunteer for the vanguard myself..."""
ssc_505020_0310#0,"""If you don't mind, please tell me<br>what it's like up there one of these days."""
ssc_505020_0320#0,"""It was good seeing you."""
