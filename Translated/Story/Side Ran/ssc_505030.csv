ssc_505030_0040#0,"""By all means."""
ssc_505030_0050#0,"""The Stia region?"""
ssc_505030_0060#0,"""Understood.<br>I'll get started then."""
ssc_505030_0070#0,"""Stia is the fourth region of Hapha, after Aelio, Retem, and Kvaris."""
ssc_505030_0080#0,"""The Stia region is the giant volcanic<br>island just beyond Halphiria Lake."""
ssc_505030_0090#0,"""We've been developing a vanguard<br>unit in Stia, just like in Kvaris."""
ssc_505030_0100#0,"""While it's been years since they advanced<br>into the region, not much progress has been made."""
ssc_505030_0110#0,"""There are three problems..."""
ssc_505030_0120#0,"""The first being the<br>horribly complex terrain."""
ssc_505030_0130#0,"""The second being the presence of<br>a large number of powerful DOLLS."""
ssc_505030_0140#0,"""The third being a lack of proper cooperation<br>between Central City and the vanguard unit."""
ssc_505030_0150#0,"""...Energy plants and similar facilities have been<br>found within Stia's multi-layered interior."""

ssc_505030_0200#0,"""Well..."""
ssc_505030_0210#0,"""The details should be in the vanguard's report,<br>but correspondence has slowed to a crawl..."""

ssc_505030_0230#0,"""However, Crawford didn't give them his approval,<br>saying it was still too early to act."""
ssc_505030_0240#0,"""We need to strengthen the defenses of every region.<br>But the DOLLS in the Stia region also can't go unchecked."""
