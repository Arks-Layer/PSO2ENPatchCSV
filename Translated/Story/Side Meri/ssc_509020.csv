ssc_509020_0010#0,"""Oh, welcome!"""
ssc_509020_0020#0,"""What's on today's agenda?"""
ssc_509020_0030#0,"""How've you been?"""
ssc_509020_0040#0,"""Are your brothers doing well?"""
ssc_509020_0050#0,"""Quite well, thankfully."""
ssc_509020_0060#0,"""Yeah, almost too well."""
ssc_509020_0070#0,"""Ilma is just as devoted to<br>his research as ever."""
ssc_509020_0080#0,"""I think Taivas and Tulli have been<br>competing to see who can take down more enemies."""
ssc_509020_0090#0,"""And Kukka's been helping me out a lot lately."""
ssc_509020_0100#0,"""In that respect, they're<br>the same as they've always been."""
ssc_509020_0110#0,"""They have changed in other ways, though..."""
ssc_509020_0120#0,"""Kukka's been going outside<br>with the others more often."""
ssc_509020_0130#0,"""Sometimes he'll go take out some<br>enemies with Taivas and Tulli ..."""
ssc_509020_0140#0,"""Other times he'll help Ilma<br>with his field research."""
ssc_509020_0150#0,"""As for Taivas and Tulli, they actually<br>stick together more often out on the field."""
ssc_509020_0160#0,"""Whereas before they would split up,<br>with one going east, and the other going west."""
ssc_509020_0170#0,"""It also feels like they've been<br>helping me out more often."""
ssc_509020_0180#0,"""They come with me to hunt Tames,<br>or gather fruits and vegetables."""
ssc_509020_0190#0,"""I want to say there are things<br>I help out with too, but..."""
ssc_509020_0200#0,"""Like, when Ilma starts really investigating something,<br>everything he says is just gibberish to me."""
ssc_509020_0210#0,"""...Speaking of conversations, there've been<br>more chances to talk with Aina and Manon too."""
ssc_509020_0220#0,"""Aina's been telling me about all of her travels so far,<br>and what it was like back in Aelio Town and stuff."""
ssc_509020_0230#0,"""She's been through so much hardship."""
ssc_509020_0240#0,"""But she doesn't have any trouble<br>talking to me about it."""
ssc_509020_0250#0,"""'Cause we've both<br>been through hard times."""
ssc_509020_0260#0,"""That makes me really happy."""
ssc_509020_0270#0,"""And then there's Manon."""
ssc_509020_0280#0,"""She teaches me all this stuff I've never would've<br>known about, since I've always just lived up here."""
ssc_509020_0290#0,"""All the different creatures<br>and environments and stuff."""
ssc_509020_0300#0,"""Sometimes she talks about stuff I don't understand,<br>but she's nowhere near as bad as Ilma."""
ssc_509020_0310#0,"""Oh, hey. Do you have<br>some time after this?"""
ssc_509020_0320#0,"""I want you to tell me<br>a bit about yourself as well."""
ssc_509020_0330#0,"""I'd love to."""
ssc_509020_0340#0,"""Sure, but not for long."""
ssc_509020_0350#0,"""Alright, good."""
ssc_509020_0360#0,"""Alright, that's fine."""
ssc_509020_0370#0,"""Here, let's talk inside the lodge."""
