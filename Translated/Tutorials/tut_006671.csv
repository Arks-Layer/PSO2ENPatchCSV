Title#0,"""Line Strike Game Rules"""
text0001#0,"""<yellow>Line Strike<c> is a two-player card game, in which players take turns playing cards from their hand, using the total Power Level of those cards to do battle.<br><br>The game board is divided into three vertical zones, called \""Lines\"", and players' objective is to gain control of these Lines in order to attack and destroy the enemy base."""
text0002#0,"""At the end of each turn, whichever player has the most total Power Level on a Line has the right to attack on that Line.<br><br>Each player has a durability gauge, called a <yellow>Base<c>, at their end of the Line. The attacking player can deal 1-3 damage to their opponent's Base for each <yellow>Ally Card<c> they have on the Line.<br><br>When a Base's durability reaches 0, that Base is destroyed. The first player to destroy two of their opponent's Bases is the winner."""
text0003#0,"""At the beginning of the game, you draw 5 cards from your Deck to be your opening hand. You then have one opportunity to shuffle your hand back into the Deck and draw a new hand.<br><br>On every turn after the first, you draw 1 card from your Deck at the start of your turn. You also draw 1 card when one of your Bases is destroyed."""
text0004#0,"""Placing a card onto the field is referred to as <yellow>Summoning<c> it.<br><br>Summoning costs a resource called <yellow>PP<c>. The exact cost depends on the card. You can Summon as many times as you like in one turn, as long as you have enough PP to pay for it.<br><br>At the start of your turn, you gain <yellow>3 PP<c>. Unused PP can be carried over from one turn to another, up to 10 PP maximum."""
text0005#0,"""When you Summon a card, instead of placing it into an empty space, you can place it over the top of a card you previously placed. This is called a <yellow>Rewrite Summon<c>.<br><br>If the Summoned card has the <yellow>same Attribute<c> as the card it is being placed over, and <yellow>costs more PP to Summon<c>, the Rewrite Summon will only cost you the difference between their PP costs.<br><br>â€»Any effects applied to the card already on the field will not be carried over to the Summoned card."""
text0006#0,"""Some cards have a special effect, called a <yellow>Skill<c>.<br><br>There are three types of Skill: <yellow>\""Support\""<c>, <yellow>\""Disruption\""<c> and <yellow>\""Passive\""<c>. Support Skills, which strengthen allies, and Disruption Skills, which weaken enemies, are applied only once when the card is played on the field. Support Skills activate before Disruption Skills.<br><br>Passive Skills simply apply continuously. For example, a card's power may be boosted by the number of allies it has, and this would change as cards are played."""
text0007#0,"""When a card's Power Level reaches 0, such as by a Disruption Skill, it becomes <yellow>incapacitated<c>.<br><br>An incapacitated card cannot participate in battles, and its Passive Skill (if any) does not apply, but it can still be overwritten with another card via Rewrite Summon.<br><br>If an incapacitated card's Power Level returns to 1 or higher, it is no longer incapacitated."""
