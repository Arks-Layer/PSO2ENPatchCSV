text0001#0,"""A Launcher is a powerful long-range weapon capable of bombarding a wide area with every shot.<br><br>Its Weapon Action, \""Sticky Bomb\"", attaches a bomb to the target which explodes after a short delay. When it explodes, you recover PP. The more damage you deal to the enemy after attaching the bomb, the more PP you recover.<br>"""
text0002#0,"""The PA \""Fallen Impact\"" locks on to a target location, then bombards it with explosive shots a short time afterwards.<br><br>You can use this delay to help maximize PP recovery from Sticky Bomb. Simply use Fallen Impact on a target before attaching Sticky Bomb to that same target. Fallen Impact will damage the target during Sticky Bomb's countdown, and you will still be able to focus fire on that target with other moves during the entire countdown."""
