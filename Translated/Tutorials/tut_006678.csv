text0001#0,"""Legacy Chests are objects which can be unlocked to receive items, at the cost of some of the Exploration Points that you've earned during your current Quest.<br><br>Legacy Chests come in Blue, Green and Red varieties. The amount of Exploration Points it takes to unlock one depends on the color: Blue takes the least, then Green, then Red takes the most. However, the more expensive the chest, the more valuable the rewards."""
