To generate an Add-On Skill, you need an appropriate N-Class Excube, such as an N-Hu Excube.<br><br>Each Add-On Skill has one fixed Main Effect based on the Class chosen, and two randomly-generated Sub Effects. The strength of the Sub Effects depends on the Skill's randomly-generated \""Effect Level\""."""
