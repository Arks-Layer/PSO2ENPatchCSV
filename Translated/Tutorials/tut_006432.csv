Title#0,"""Jet Boots"""
text0001#0,"""Jet Boots are melee weapons notable for their powerful kicks and high aerial maneuverability. You can use Techniques while you have them equipped.<br><br>The Class Skill \""Jet Boots Element Set\"" imbues your Jet Boots with an Attribute when you use a Technique. While imbued with an Attribute, your Jet Boots PAs will trigger an additional attack when striking enemies, based on that Attribute."""
text0002#0,"""The Class Skill \""Jet Intensity\"" allows you to hold the Normal Attack button to perform a continual series of attacks which get faster over time. If you land every attack, you will deal a tremendous amount of damage.<br><br>You will not be able to evade attacks while using Jet Intensity, so it is best used when enemies are incapable of interrupting you, such as when they've been Downed."""
text0003#0,"""The PA \""Spinning Gust\"" lets you move forward while spinning vertically, focusing your attack on a single enemy.<br><br>If you hold the PA button, you will consume a little extra PP, but the second half of the PA will become a powerful roundhouse kick."""
