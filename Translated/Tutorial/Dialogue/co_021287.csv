text01#0,"""Explanation of Mining Base Defense Training: Incursion In this battle, the stage is the scattered area of the <yellow>makeshift sites<c> that are under construction. Darkers will attack from the northern part of the map. Let's ambush them and protect the makeshift sites from destruction."""
text02#0,"""As the makeshift sites are not constructed strongly, they cannot withstand attacks from Darkers for a long time. Be alert about the health of the makeshift sites, to prevent them from being destroyed."""
text03#0,"""The <yellow>barriers<c> that are aligned in front of the makeshift sites are called [<yellow>Last defensive line<c>]. Attacks from Hostiles might result in their locations moving southwards. So for a stronger defense, ensure that they appear close to the makeshift sites."""
text04#0,"""As both the hit attack of Kuklonahda and Cyclonehda and the self-destruct attack of Goldrahdas can cause severe damage to the barriers, defeat them first."""
