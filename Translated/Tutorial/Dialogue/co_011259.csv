text01#0,"""As you complete your Matter board or complete Story Quests, sometimes the characters involved in the events will disappear from the ARKS Ship."""
text02#0,"""When that happens, if you head to the place listed under that event on the Matter board, an event will be recreated in chronological order, so you will be able to return to and encounter that character.  Please complete the game at your own pace, without rushing."""
