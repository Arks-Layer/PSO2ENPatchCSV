text01#0,"""There are six elements in this universe: fire, ice, lightning, wind, light, and dark.  You can inflict additional damage by attacking with weapons or techniques that apply an elemental effect. When an enemy is resistant to a certain type of element, additional damage from that element is reduced.  In this case, use weapons or techniques of a different element."""
