text020_A#0,"""The name's Barry. Good to meet you."""
text010#0,"""Oh, this? This is my garden! If you see a vegetable you want to eat, you go right ahead and take one. Now that we're acquainted, and all."""
text020#0,"""Or so I'd like to say... You see, there's been a lot of enemies making a right mess of my field, lately!"""
text030#0,"""They wouldn't be that big of a deal normally, but there's just been so many of 'em! Look, there's some over there skulking about right now!"""
text040#0,"""I hate to impose, friend, but could you get rid of them for me? I'm also kinda curious to see what you're capable of."""
text010_C#0,"""You're my savior! You made quick work of that!"""
text020_C#0,"""Listen, as thanks for protecting my field, I'll send a bunch of fresh vegetables your way later."""
