Explanation#0,"""Manon sits on Felusa Ridge, a glum expression on her face as she remembers the soldier who died defending her in the battle against Nilus Stia. Kanui appears, and tells her that the soldier was only doing his duty. That he made the best decision he could to ensure as many people as possible made it out alive. Therefore, she says, she shouldn't blame herself. Only look towards the future."""
