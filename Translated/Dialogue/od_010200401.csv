text02#0,"""That's probably why I never get to see them. I mean, I basically work on my own and I always run away before battles even get started."""
text03#0,"""I don't think I'll be seeing one anytime soon, considering, and I can't help but feel like Iâ€™m missing out on something."""
text04#0,"""Could you maybe do me a favor? The next time you experience a PSE burst, could you collect some data on it?"""
text05#0,"""It'll be super easy, 'cause all you have to do is experience it. The data gets collected automatically!"""
text100#0,"""PSE"""
text101#0,"""Defeating enemies stimulates the photons in the atmosphere, which affects the abilities of ARKS operatives. This effect is known as PSE (Photon Saturation Effect).  PSE can cause anything from a simple boost in abilities, to an increase in the amount of meseta dropped, or extra experience from combat."""
text102#0,"""There are eight levels of PSE, and the level rises as you continue to defeat enemies, enhancing the effect produced.  When photons are stimulated at PSE level 8, a PSE burst is triggered. This results in a dramatic stat boost due to the violent excitation of atmospheric photons caused by cumulative PSEs."""
text103#0,"""This effect only lasts a limited time, but it can be extended by defeating enemies to keep photons in a state of excitation.  A sign of some kind is given just before PSE is about to occur, so keep an eye out and utilize PSE to its best effect."""
