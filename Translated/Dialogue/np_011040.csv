'Red Rappy Group', 'Blue Rappy Group' who will then compete for <c ff007f>'Winning Points'<c>.  The group that remains with the most <yellow>'Winning Points'<c> will win the competition.  This event is navigated by <c ffa800>'Arkuma'<c>. By accessing Arkuma, you may confirm you current targets and place, or <yellow>purchase rewards<c> using 'Stars'<pict sb_star_icon> you have acquired. """
text02#0,"""<yellow>What do I do?<c>  In the course of this event, each player will complete 'Round Targets', achieving reward <yellow>Stars <pict sb_star_icon> and 'Contribution Points'<c>. The group with the most Contribution Points will eventually achieve a higher <cff007f>'Winning Point'.  <green>What is a Round Target?<c>  An ARKS Ship Combat comprises of several 'Rounds'.

"""
text03#0,"""<yellow> Winning and Losing <c>  At the end of each round, all competitors' 'Contribution Points' will be calculated, and 'Winning Points' will be distributed in the order of the teams with the most Contribution Points.  Once all round have been completed, the team with the most 'Overall Winning Points' will win the competition, E.g. first place is 5 points, the second place is 4.  Once the rounds have finished, the large monitor in the shop area will show a 'Result Presentation', so when you hear the announcement make sure you gather around the monitor!  Once the 'Final Result Presentation' is over, all competitors will be given Stars <pict sb_star_icon> as their placing reward, and there will be more prizes lining up in Arkuma's shop.  You will receive better prizes based on your competition standing, so try to aim for the higher places! """
