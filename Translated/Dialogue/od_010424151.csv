text101#0,"""This is an explanation of the double sabers gear system.  By learning the \""double sabers\"" skill, a gear gauge will be added to the top of the Weapon Palette.  The gear gauge will charge when landing attacks with double sabers."""

Since the gear gauge will charge when the tornado hits hostiles, it's possible to continuously attack if the hits land well."""
