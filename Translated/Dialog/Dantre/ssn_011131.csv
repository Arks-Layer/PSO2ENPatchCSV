ssn_011131_0001#0,"""Alright then, let's talk."""
ssn_011131_0101#0,"""Hmm...<br>Seems like your Class isn't Fighter."""
ssn_011131_0102#0,"""If you want to learn how to fight from me, you'll need to change your Class to Fighter at the Class Counter."""
ssn_011131_0103#0,"""And don't forget to pick up some of Fighter's Class Skills while you're there!"""
ssn_011131_0104#0,"""...Well, since you're here now, I'll tell you a bit about Fighter."""
ssn_011131_0201#0,"""Fighter is a class that excels in close-range combat! Its most notable feature is its massive striking power!"""
ssn_011131_0202#0,"""Its attacks are a bit of an eclectic mixture. Great for putting on a show as you fight!"""
ssn_011131_0203#0,"""On the other hand, its attack range tends to be pretty short and narrow, so you'll need to get up close and personal with your enemies."""
ssn_011131_0204#0,"""Its Class Skills can help a lot with that! The one I recommend getting first is Limit Break."""
ssn_011131_0205#0,"""Well, the best way to learn it is to just get out there and do it! I'll assign you some objectives so you can try it out!"""
