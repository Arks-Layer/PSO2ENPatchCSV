ssn_015171_0101#0,"""Okay! I'll start explaining, so listen closely!"""
ssn_015171_0102#0,"""...Er, wait. It doesn't look like your current Class is Waker."""
ssn_015171_0103#0,"""If you want to learn how Wakers fight, go to the Class Counter and set your Class to Waker, okay?"""
ssn_015171_0104#0,"""Also, take a good look at Waker's Class Skills while you're there, okay? I mean it!"""
ssn_015171_0105#0,"""... Well, I'll just tell you about Wakers beforehand anyways."""
ssn_015171_0106#0,"""Wakers fight alongside 3 different kinds of \""Familiars\"". That means they have 3 different avenues of dealing with enemies. Cool, huh?"""
ssn_015171_0107#0,"""... Hm? What's a Familiar, you ask?"""
ssn_015171_0108#0,"""Familiars are like a Waker's \""comrades\""--No, more like our \""familia\"": Our family!"""
ssn_015171_0109#0,"""We can fight alongside our Familiars, or we can let them handle an enemy while we take on another."""
ssn_015171_0110#0,"""Let's see... First, I'd like you to learn the Class Skills \""Takt Gear\"" and \""Familiar Assist\""."""
ssn_015171_0111#0,"""Make good use of your Skills, and build a healthy camaraderie with your Familiars. That'll be your homework for today!"""
