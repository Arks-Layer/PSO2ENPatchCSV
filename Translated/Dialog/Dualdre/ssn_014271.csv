ssn_014271_0001#0,"""Alright, let's get started."""
ssn_014271_0101#0,"""...Mm? Doesn't look like your Class is Braver."""
ssn_014271_0102#0,"""Gonna have to get you to sign up as a Braver at the Class Counter first. Gets the formalities out of the way, y'know?"""
ssn_014271_0103#0,"""While you're there, give Braver's Class Skills a good looking-over. Commit 'em to memory."""
ssn_014271_0104#0,"""But hey, I might as well tell you what the Class is all about while you're here."""
ssn_014271_0201#0,"""Bravers are a Class geared toward excelling at both close- and long-ranged combat."""
ssn_014271_0202#0,"""With a Katana for close-quarters, and a Bullet Bow for long distance, we can adapt to any situation out in the field."""
ssn_014271_0203#0,"""Our attacks might seem simple on the surface, but that's what makes it such an art."""
ssn_014271_0204#0,"""Just like any other class, Class Skills are your bread and butter. First, you should master \""Brave Combat\""."""
ssn_014271_0205#0,"""I'll give you this assignment for now, so go try it out."""
