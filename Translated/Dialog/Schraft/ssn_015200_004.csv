ssn_015200_004_0002#0,"""Have you heard of the \""Hindras Lily\""?"""
ssn_015200_004_0003#0,"""They're these huge flower-like objects that've been spotted in Resol Forest."""
ssn_015200_004_0004#0,"""They're still being studied, so we're not sure whether they're an organism or a machine."""
ssn_015200_004_0005#0,"""Due to the timing of the discovery, we suspect they might have some relation to the Starless, but it could just be coincidence."""
ssn_015200_004_0006#0,"""Hindras Lilies are normally in their budding stage, spreading explosive Photon pellets around them."""
ssn_015200_004_0007#0,"""But if you then attack them, their petals will fan out, causing a huge explosion and accompanying shockwave."""
ssn_015200_004_0008#0,"""You might actually be able to use that shockwave to your advantage during battle..."""
ssn_015200_004_0009#0,"""First though, I just want you to go out and get a good look at one of these Hindras Lilies with your own eyes."""
ssn_015200_004_0010#0,"""Be careful when you're up close to it, though!"""
