ssn_019060_001_0001#0,"""Thanks for coming. Let me introduce myself again."""
ssn_019060_001_0002#0,"""I'm Citrae. I'm from the Central City Supply Corps, and I'm in charge of managing supplies to support combat operations."""
ssn_019060_001_0003#0,"""Supply lines are the backbone of any fighting force! Our job is to keep our combat teams supplied, no matter where they are!"""
ssn_019060_001_0004#0,"""Problem is, enemy activity has really stepped up lately. They're blocking our convoys and chasing our procurement squads away."""
ssn_019060_001_0005#0,"""Would you help secure our supply lines by clearing those enemies out?"""
ssn_019060_001_0006#0,"""First up... Enemies marked with a special symbol have been particularly active lately, so start by going after them."""
ssn_019060_001_0007#0,"""If you do really well, I might just have a reward for you!"""
ssn_019060_001_0008#0,"""Alright then, I look forward to working with you!"""
ssn_019060_001_0101#0,"""Supply lines are the backbone of any fighting force! We won't let a few enemies get in our way!"""
ssn_019060_001_0102#0,"""There are kind of a lot of enemies right now, though..."""
ssn_019060_001_0201#0,"""Oh hey, you're back.<br>Yeah, this is exactly what I wanted!"""
ssn_019060_001_0202#0,"""You've been a huge help. These should add a bit of color to people's meals."""
ssn_019060_001_0203#0,"""As thanks, I'll give you some of my signature dish, Balloonimix. You should give it a try!"""
ssn_019060_001_0204#0,"""Go on, eat up! You'll need plenty of energy out there!"""
ssn_019060_001_0205#0,"""...Soooo, how about you go take down some symbol-marked Enhanced Enemies next?"""
ssn_019060_001_0206#0,"""We don't get much combat training in the Supply Corps, so I'm terrible at aiming for Enhancers."""
ssn_019060_001_0207#0,"""I'll just leave it to you. Good luck!"""
ssn_019060_001_0301#0,"""Welcome back! You're not hurt, are you?"""
ssn_019060_001_0302#0,"""You've really helped me out on this one. Thanks a ton."""
ssn_019060_001_0303#0,"""It'll be way easier to get supplies through with those enemies out of the way. We should be able to ship to anywhere now."""
ssn_019060_001_0304#0,"""Here! It's my thanks for everything you've done!"""
ssn_019060_001_0305#0,"""I've been able to scrape some other items together here, so if there's anything you need, just let me know."""
ssn_019060_001_0306#0,"""And if enemy numbers start building up again, you can go stamp 'em back out!"""
ssn_019060_001_0401#0,"""Welcome back! Alright, I guess you're wondering what's up."""
ssn_019060_001_0402#0,"""Long story short, an ARKS recon team in Western Aelio reported seeing a lot of symbol-marked enemies there."""
ssn_019060_001_0403#0,"""I hear a battle group is being put together to go deal with them. Since you seem to be kind of an expert, I was wondering if you could go help them out?"""
ssn_019060_001_0404#0,"""They'll put out an announcement before the operation begins, so that'll be your cue to get ready."""
ssn_019060_001_0405#0,"""Oh, almost forgot. I heard there's some unusual enemies mixed in with them, so watch yourself out there."""
