ssc_503010_0030#0,"""Even now, I struggle to come to terms with it."""
ssc_503010_0040#0,"""That something so awful<br>could happen to Aelio Town."""
ssc_503010_0050#0,"""Aelio Town was like Aelio's western bastion,<br>guarding the coastline from top to bottom."""
ssc_503010_0060#0,"""They covered Central City's blindspot, as view of the<br>coastline is obstructed by the mountain range."""
ssc_503010_0070#0,"""Aye, there have been many DOLLS attacks that came from the sea,<br>making it hard to judge when or where they'll appear."""
ssc_503010_0080#0,"""The people of Aelio Town knew those circumstances<br>and would immediately put a stop to any such encroachment."""
ssc_503010_0090#0,"""Thanks to that, Central City had seldom been met with crisis."""

ssc_503010_0130#0,"""His experience-forged intuition and<br>quick thinking was second to none."""
ssc_503010_0140#0,"""Aelio Town and Central City would often get together for co-op training drills."""
ssc_503010_0150#0,"""Garoa and I would eventually form something of a<br>friendly rivalry between the two of us."""
ssc_503010_0160#0,"""During those days, Garoa and I would<br>often compete amongst ourselves."""
ssc_503010_0170#0,"""In the end, I wasn't able to win<br>any of our little contests even once."""

ssc_503010_0190#0,"""Did you go easy because it was just training?"""
ssc_503010_0200#0,"""Aye. Every single time."""
ssc_503010_0210#0,"""I wasn't holding back at all."""
ssc_503010_0220#0,"""If anything, he was the one who was going easy on me."""
ssc_503010_0230#0,"""In other words, I ended up quitting while I was ahead."""
ssc_503010_0240#0,"""I doubt we'll ever see an ARKS of his caliber again."""
ssc_503010_0250#0,"""He was an absolute force of nature on<br>the battlefield, and a good man at heart."""
