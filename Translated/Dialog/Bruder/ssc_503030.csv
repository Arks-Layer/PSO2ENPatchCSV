ssc_503030_0020#0,"""What are you doing here?"""
ssc_503030_0030#0,"""Mt. Magnus..."""
ssc_503030_0040#0,"""I just finished up a mission here and was about to head back."""
ssc_503030_0050#0,"""This place reminds me of the day we both<br>stood and fought alongside one another."""
ssc_503030_0060#0,"""... Aye."""
ssc_503030_0070#0,"""Brings back memories of that day, doesn't it?"""
ssc_503030_0080#0,"""You, Aina, and Manon's first mission."""
ssc_503030_0090#0,"""You three had only just finished your<br>basic training, but you all fought admirably."""
ssc_503030_0100#0,"""When your Trainia results came back, it was I who made the claim<br>that you three were ready for field combat, but..."""
ssc_503030_0110#0,"""I didn't think you'd have to join a fight immediately afterwards."""
ssc_503030_0120#0,"""Though your results showed that Crawford<br>clearly made the right judgement."""
ssc_503030_0130#0,"""In terms of adaptability, you and Manon are<br>in a league of your own, even among Meteorn."""
ssc_503030_0140#0,"""I'd like you to walk your own path just like that."""
ssc_503030_0150#0,"""Aina, on the other hand, had lost her loved ones<br>and had just recovered from her injuries."""
ssc_503030_0160#0,"""If I had to say, her aim was still rather unsteady<br>and she seemed considerably unsure of herself."""
ssc_503030_0170#0,"""And then, that fateful encounter.<br>She showed such courage and willpower."""
ssc_503030_0180#0,"""Compared to you Meteorn, she's still<br>rough around the edges, aye..."""
ssc_503030_0190#0,"""But, given time and experience, she has an inexhaustible fountain of potential."""
ssc_503030_0200#0,"""One's mental state is of utmost importance."""
ssc_503030_0210#0,"""Aina seems to be in a rush to achieve results<br>and to keep up with you Meteorn."""
ssc_503030_0220#0,"""Though I must commend her ability to rationally<br>come to terms with the tragedy that befell Aelio Town..."""
ssc_503030_0230#0,"""Without being so much as caught up in anger..."""
ssc_503030_0240#0,"""A mind that has been strengthened with<br>hatred and anger is easily corrupted."""
ssc_503030_0250#0,"""If she stays true to herself and continues to<br>hone her abilities, she'll be just fine."""
ssc_503030_0260#0,"""Slowly, and steadily."""
ssc_503030_0270#0,"""I'd like you and Manon to support her as best you can."""
ssc_503030_0280#0,"""No... Manon, too, seems to be carrying<br>some sort of burden of her own."""
ssc_503030_0290#0,"""I want you to support both of them through your actions."""
