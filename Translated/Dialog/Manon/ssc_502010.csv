ssc_502010_0020#0,"""Nice job."""
ssc_502010_0030#0,"""Something on your mind?"""
ssc_502010_0040#0,"""... Kyah?!"""
ssc_502010_0050#0,"""... Fueh?!"""
ssc_502010_0060#0,"""Ah, you scared me. So you came here too..."""
ssc_502010_0070#0,"""I must have had my head in the clouds to not notice your presence. Perhaps I am out of my usual sorts."""
ssc_502010_0080#0,"""... I come here often when I want to be alone."""
ssc_502010_0090#0,"""When I hear the sound of the water, it feels like it unravels all of the stress that's been tying up my mind."""
ssc_502010_0100#0,"""Didn't think you were the type."""
ssc_502010_0110#0,"""Is something the matter?"""
ssc_502010_0120#0,"""Well yes, even I have to wind down eventually."""
ssc_502010_0130#0,"""Not really. ...Not to say I don't have my reservations, though."""
ssc_502010_0140#0,"""There are many things I wish I had done differently."""
ssc_502010_0150#0,"""Lots of what-ifs. What if I did this instead of that? What if I said this instead of that?"""
ssc_502010_0160#0,"""I'm always regretting my own actions..."""
ssc_502010_0170#0,"""..."""
ssc_502010_0180#0,"""Though Aina looks at me like she thinks I'm amazing or something."""
ssc_502010_0190#0,"""I happen to have a lot of useful knowledge, but it doesn't mean anything if I can't actually put it into practice."""
ssc_502010_0200#0,"""If anyone's amazing, it's her."""
ssc_502010_0210#0,"""To have experienced what she has experienced, and yet still be able to look forward and keep moving on."""
ssc_502010_0220#0,"""All without having to close herself off, much less lose herself in anger."""
ssc_502010_0230#0,"""If someone like her looks up to me like that, I can't just go and betray her expectations of me."""
ssc_502010_0240#0,"""That's why, at least when I'm in front of her, I want to be the strongest version of myself."""
ssc_502010_0250#0,"""Wait... Why am I telling all of this to you...?"""
ssc_502010_0260#0,"""Hehehe. You're a mysterious individual, aren't you?"""
ssc_502010_0270#0,"""I'm not even sure what goes through your head most of the time, but it feels like I could talk to you about anything."""
ssc_502010_0280#0,"""That's probably why Aina also places so much trust in you as well."""
ssc_502010_0290#0,"""...I hope you'll keep this conversation a secret from Aina."""
ssc_502010_0300#0,"""One day, I'll definitely open up to her and tell her everything that's on my mind... But not yet."""
ssc_502010_0310#0,"""Promise... Okay?"""
