ssc_502020_0020#0,"""... You come here too?"""
ssc_502020_0030#0,"""I could ask you the same."""
ssc_502020_0040#0,"""Every now and then... yeah."""
ssc_502020_0050#0,"""...I do, occasionally."""
ssc_502020_0060#0,"""I see you do as well."""
ssc_502020_0070#0,"""Even now, I still can't<br>believe what happened here."""
ssc_502020_0080#0,"""And you... It happened just<br>as you arrived on Halpha."""
ssc_502020_0090#0,"""Aelio Town was...<br>a wonderful village."""
ssc_502020_0100#0,"""Everyone was so warm,<br>so welcoming..."""
ssc_502020_0110#0,"""When I arrived on Halpha, the door to my pod<br>malfunctioned and I was unable to get out of it."""

ssc_502020_0130#0,"""They gathered so many people<brto help open the door to my pod."""

ssc_502020_0160#0,"""And then, they couldn't wait to tell me<br>all about this world I found myself on."""
ssc_502020_0170#0,"""Everyone was so strong, too. Even medium-sized<br>DOLLS were hardly a match for any of them."""
ssc_502020_0180#0,"""Garoa was in a league of his own. He would<br>take down so many giant DOLLS all by himself."""
