ssn_015510_0001#0,"""Yo! Takin' good care of your equipment?"""
ssn_015510_0002#0,"""It don't matter how strong an ARKS is; if their equipment's in tatters, they can't fight at their best."""
ssn_015510_0003#0,"""Think of your gear as your most valuable partner, and afford it as much respect."""
ssn_015510_0101#0,"""Just the ARKS I wanted to see."""
ssn_015510_0102#0,"""I'm Shioji, and I do equipment research here in Stia."""
ssn_015510_0103#0,"""What say you sit a spell and listen to some advice I've got for ya?"""
ssn_015510_0201#0,"""I need you to get some data on the Ore known as \""Hexakite\""."""
ssn_015510_0202#0,"""They say it can be found in Outer Mediola: Sector 2. Thanks again."""
ssn_015510_0301#0,"""Oh, you're busy. Let me know if you get some spare time."""
ssn_015510_0401#0,"""You're back! Alright, lay 'em out here and I'll start scanning them."""
ssn_015510_0402#0,"""...Hm-hm... I see."""
ssn_015510_0403#0,"""As I thought, this Ore structure is quite different from those found in Aelio."""
ssn_015510_0404#0,"""We might be able to use these to make adjustments to new equipment as well."""
ssn_015510_0405#0,"""I'll be sure to inform the technology department and have them use this information to improve our equipment."""
ssn_015510_0406#0,"""It looks like Stia may have its own wealth of useful Ores."""
ssn_015510_0407#0,"""Alright! My inner researcher is starting to reawaken!"""
ssn_015510_0408#0,"""I got some valuable data thanks to you."""
ssn_015510_0409#0,"""I appreciate it. I hope to be able to depend on you if something else comes up."""
ssn_015510_1001#0,"""Here in Stia, every day is a battle."""
ssn_015510_1002#0,"""If your gear ain't in perfect condition, it doesn't matter how many lives you've got, they won't be enough."""
ssn_015510_1101#0,"""Ho there! I heard you played a big part in that last battle."""
ssn_015510_1102#0,"""Taking those abilities into account, there's another favor I'd like to ask of you."""
ssn_015510_1103#0,"""Would you consider it?"""
ssn_015510_1201#0,"""\""Inferium\"" can be gathered in Outer Mediola: Sector 1."""
ssn_015510_1202#0,"""There's rumors that you can only find it during certain weather."""
ssn_015510_1203#0,"""I know it's a lot to ask, but since it's you, I have faith that it'll work out."""
ssn_015510_1301#0,"""Oh, alright... Come back if you change your mind!"""
ssn_015510_1401#0,"""Oh, you're back. Let me start the data scan right away."""
ssn_015510_1402#0,"""...Hum. So this is \""Inferium\""... The rumors simply don't do it justice!"""
ssn_015510_1403#0,"""It's some of the strongest I've seen, and it seems capable of bonding with other Ores!"""
ssn_015510_1404#0,"""Agh, I can only imagine the potential applications this could have!"""
ssn_015510_1405#0,"""Equipment made with this would easily be some of the best on the market."""
ssn_015510_1406#0,"""Hah! The folks in the technology department will be flabbergasted when they see this!"""
ssn_015510_1407#0,"""...!! Ahem! ...My apologies, it's... been a while since I've lost my composure like that."""
ssn_015510_1408#0,"""Thank you. You've really done a lot for me."""
ssn_015510_1501#0,"""Discovering new Ores often results in improvements to our equipment."""
ssn_015510_1502#0,"""When I think of what's possible with the Ores of Stia, I get far too giddy for my age."""
ssn_015510_1503#0,"""It ain't easy living in Stia, but from the bottom of my heart, I can say I'm glad I came here."""
