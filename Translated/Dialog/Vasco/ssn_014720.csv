ssn_014720_0001#0,"""Amazing! This is the first time I've ever seen this sort of scenery."""
ssn_014720_0002#0,"""When you get far enough away from Aelio, the world really changes, huh? I'm so glad I came here."""
ssn_014720_0101#0,"""Mmm... If only I could investigate more thoroughly... But, it's so difficult to--"""
ssn_014720_0102#0,"""AH! Goodness, you gave me a fright!"""
ssn_014720_0103#0,"""I'm so sorry, I was so lost in thought I didn't even notice you there."""
ssn_014720_0104#0,"""My name is Vasco. I came here as a member of the Kvaris expedition."""
ssn_014720_0105#0,"""Kvaris is a fascinating place, isn't it? It's hard to believe it used to be a grassy verdant land."""
ssn_014720_0106#0,"""That's why I'm here, actually: to look into what exactly happened to this place."""
ssn_014720_0107#0,"""If you've got some time, do you think you could lend me a hand?"""
ssn_014720_0201#0,"""I need you to gather Pendrite from Western Kvaris. I'll send your Mag some data so it can point to any that you come across."""
ssn_014720_0301#0,"""Oh? You don't seem very interested. That's too bad..."""
ssn_014720_0401#0,"""Thank you very much."""
ssn_014720_0402#0,"""Wow! Real Pendrite! I've never seen it in person before!"""
ssn_014720_0403#0,"""Now I suppose I'll give it a full scan, now that I finally can!"""
ssn_014720_0404#0,"""Oh, don't worry. I'll give it back to you once I'm done scanning it."""
ssn_014720_0405#0,"""...It's certainly clear that these minerals were formed in a much gentler environment."""
ssn_014720_0406#0,"""There's no way they would've been able to form in such harsh weather like this."""
ssn_014720_0407#0,"""In other words, this Pendrite formed when the land still had a temperate climate."""
ssn_014720_0408#0,"""Well? Don't you think that's interesting? By examining the rocks, we can learn more about the history of this place."""
ssn_014720_0409#0,"""...Oh, the scan's finished. Thank you very much. I'll give this Pendrite back to you now."""
ssn_014720_0410#0,"""Research is my area of expertise. I want to gather data for all kinds of things, not just the rock formations."""
ssn_014720_0411#0,"""Do you think you could continue to help me with this? I'd really appreciate the assistance."""
ssn_014720_1001#0,"""Oh, hello again. Are you headed out shortly?"""
ssn_014720_1002#0,"""If you are, there's something I'd like you to do for me."""
ssn_014720_1101#0,"""I can't fight, so I put my effort into my resarch."""
ssn_014720_1102#0,"""I'll be waiting here. Best of luck."""
ssn_014720_1201#0,"""...I see. Sorry for asking at such a busy time."""
ssn_014720_1301#0,"""Great work. Oooh, so these are the carrots."""
ssn_014720_1302#0,"""I should be able to study these and get a better understanding of the Kvaris geology."""
ssn_014720_1303#0,"""What a peculiar shape. I wonder how it's able to grow in such inhospitable climes."""
ssn_014720_1304#0,"""...It's been in the back of my mind, but Kvaris' environment is rather unnatural in many ways, isn't it?"""
ssn_014720_1305#0,"""Not just Kvaris, either. There's something about Halpha entirely that just feels... off."""
ssn_014720_1306#0,"""Like, why does the environment change so drastically from region to region?"""
ssn_014720_1307#0,"""The creatures also vastly differ between borders."""
ssn_014720_1308#0,"""Is it even possible for such extreme variations to occur naturally like this?"""
ssn_014720_1309#0,"""I've carried out a considerable amount of research, but so far I haven't been able to find an explanation."""
ssn_014720_1310#0,"""However, if I continue my research like so, I believe an answer will be within reach some day."""
ssn_014720_1311#0,"""Thanks again for today. I hope to be able to count on you again."""
ssn_014720_2001#0,"""Oh, good timing. Do you have a moment?"""
ssn_014720_2002#0,"""Yes, I have another request for you."""
ssn_014720_2003#0,"""It's a bit of a strange request, but I'd appreciate it if you could help nonetheless."""
ssn_014720_2101#0,"""Please try heading to the designated point."""
ssn_014720_2102#0,"""I want to try surveying these floating objects."""
ssn_014720_2201#0,"""Ahhh, I see. That's unfortunate, but I understand."""
