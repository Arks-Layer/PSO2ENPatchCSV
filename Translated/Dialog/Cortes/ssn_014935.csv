ssn_014935_0102#0,"""Have you heard of \""Frozen Containers\""?"""
ssn_014935_0103#0,"""You know, those containers that are all covered in ice. That's what your targets are this time."""
ssn_014935_0104#0,"""It's just, the ice they're covered in is super strong, so you can't break 'em just like that."""
ssn_014935_0105#0,"""You might be able to bust 'em free with one of those ramming attacks on a Floating Board, though."""
ssn_014935_0106#0,"""Why are the containers frozen? Not my problem!"""
ssn_014935_0107#0,"""Oh, I should also mention, sometimes you won't be able to find any frozen containers out there."""
ssn_014935_0108#0,"""The snow and ice is always blowin' about every day, uncovering and covering all sorts of stuff like that."""
ssn_014935_0109#0,"""If that's the case today, just wait until tomorrow. Just take it easy, there ain't no rush."""
