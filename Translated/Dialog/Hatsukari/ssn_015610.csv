ssn_015610_0002#0,"""I figured the fighting would die down a bit ever since the mission into Stia's interior, but..."""
ssn_015610_0003#0,"""It feels like somehow it's actually gotten busier, don't it?"""
ssn_015610_0004#0,"""Either way, let's work together and get through this."""
ssn_015610_0101#0,"""Heyo! Nice timing, actually."""
ssn_015610_0102#0,"""Even though that strong enemy got smacked down, the fighting's hardly died down at all!"""

ssn_015610_0104#0,"""Our mission right now's an enemy sweep-up operation in Dext Base."""

ssn_015610_0401#0,"""The fightin' in Stia's still hasn't died down."""
ssn_015610_0402#0,"""But, thanks to you, it's better than it used to be."""
ssn_015610_0403#0,"""In other words, things've probably just broke even. Hahaha!"""
