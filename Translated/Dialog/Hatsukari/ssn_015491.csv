ssn_015491_0002#0,"""You know what an Auto Interceptor: Sonner is?"""
ssn_015491_0003#0,"""It's a nasty DOLLS support-craft that attacks indiscriminately, firin' off beams in all directions."""
ssn_015491_0004#0,"""Not only that, but its main body is protected by a shield that guards against attacks from the outside."""
ssn_015491_0005#0,"""So, to shut these Sonners up, there's just one thing you gotta do."""
ssn_015491_0006#0,"""You bust up all of its \""Dazzle Pods\"" that're scattered all over the place."""
ssn_015491_0007#0,"""If you do that, the main body's shield will lose power and deactivate."""
ssn_015491_0008#0,"""But, these Dazzle Pods all got some sorta cloaking device, making it a real pain to find 'em all."""
ssn_015491_0009#0,"""If you can, it'll be easier if you split up and search for 'em with any other ARKS in the area."""
ssn_015491_0010#0,"""So if you run into a Sonner, focus on takin' those out first!"""
