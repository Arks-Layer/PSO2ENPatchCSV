ssn_013010_0001#0,"""Welcome to Central City! Glad to have you."""
ssn_013010_0002#0,"""You're still trying to learn the ropes, are you? It might get a bit overwhelming, so give it your best, okay?"""
ssn_013010_0101#0,"""Are you familiar with \""Towers\""? ...Oh, not like the big one here in Central City."""
ssn_013010_0102#0,"""If you aren't, then I'll fill you in."""
ssn_013010_0201#0,"""If you're curious, then come see me later."""
ssn_013010_0103#0,"""It looks like your Power Level's high enough. As things are, I think you could go and challenge one of the Towers at your leisure."""
ssn_013010_0104#0,"""You should probably increase your Power Level for when that time comes. Okay? Good luck!"""
ssn_013010_0151#0,"""Towers, much like Cocoons, are Trainia--in other words, training facilities."""
ssn_013010_0152#0,"""They have a similar style to Cocoons, but I'm sure you can guess how they're different at a glance."""
ssn_013010_0153#0,"""The interior of a Tower is a lot more vast, and the opponents are a lot stronger, so make sure you increase your Power Level plenty before challenging one."""
ssn_013010_0154#0,"""Alright? Good luck!"""
ssn_013010_0301#0,"""Towers are much more effective than Cocoons at making you stronger, so if you find any others, make sure you try them out eventually."""
ssn_013010_0302#0,"""Same thing goes for those; make absolutely sure your Power Level is high enough before taking them on."""
ssn_013010_0303#0,"""Oh, right. Speaking of Power Level..."""
ssn_013010_0304#0,"""If your Power Level isn't high enough, they won't let you join certain Emergency Quests or other dangerous stuff like that."""
ssn_013010_0305#0,"""So you should probably focus on increasing your Power Level for when that time comes. Okay? Good luck!"""
