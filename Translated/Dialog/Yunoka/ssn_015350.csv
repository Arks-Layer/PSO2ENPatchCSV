ssn_015350_0001#0,"""Hm? Now there's an unfamiliar face. Ahh, you must've come here from Central."""
ssn_015350_0002#0,"""It'll probably be an intense battle, but let's all try our best to overcome it!"""
ssn_015350_0101#0,"""Yoohoo! So, what do you think of the weather in Stia?"""
ssn_015350_0102#0,"""Brutally hot, right? Making a life for yourself out here sure isn't easy, huh?"""
ssn_015350_0103#0,"""That's why, to pass the time, I've been doing research on food ingredients."""
ssn_015350_0104#0,"""It'd be nice to at least have some good food out here, don't you think?"""
ssn_015350_0105#0,"""Want me to teach ya about the ingredients around here?"""
ssn_015350_0201#0,"""You can find fruits like the \""Famed Stia Star Fruit\"" in Stia's Fringes."""
ssn_015350_0202#0,"""But they can only be picked from morning until noon, so keep that in mind."""
ssn_015350_0203#0,"""After you go and pick some yourself, I'll tell you a bit more. Go on, try and find some!"""
ssn_015350_0301#0,"""No probs, it's a busy time for everyone."""
ssn_015350_0302#0,"""No rush, come on back whenever you've got some free time."""
ssn_015350_0401#0,"""Yoohoo! You're back!"""
ssn_015350_0402#0,"""Yeah, that's a \""Famed Stia Star Fruit\""."""
ssn_015350_0403#0,"""Just lemme take a look real quick."""
ssn_015350_0404#0,"""...Wow! This one's quite the find!"""
ssn_015350_0405#0,"""With rare ingredients like this, the quality of each one you find varies wildly, y'see."""
ssn_015350_0406#0,"""They can be either super delicious or awful tasting..."""
ssn_015350_0407#0,"""I'm not sure why these can only be picked during a certain time of day either."""
ssn_015350_0408#0,"""But hey, my research should find the answer to that in due time."""
ssn_015350_0409#0,"""So yeah, these are the kinds of research materials I've been collecting."""
ssn_015350_0410#0,"""You can also give 'em to the Item Trader in exchange for other goodies."""
ssn_015350_0411#0,"""It's yours to use as you please, though."""
ssn_015350_0412#0,"""I'd probably use 'em for cooking research, though..."""
ssn_015350_1001#0,"""Yoohoo! Have you been enjoying your daily meals?"""
ssn_015350_1002#0,"""There are more rare ingredients, but I'll tell you about them another time."""
ssn_015350_1101#0,"""Yoohoo! You showed up at the perfect time."""
ssn_015350_1102#0,"""I figure it's time to talk to you about more of the rare ingredients around here."""
ssn_015350_1201#0,"""Today's subject is the \""Famed Stia Crab\""."""
ssn_015350_1202#0,"""They can be found in Outer Mediola: Sector 2."""
ssn_015350_1203#0,"""They probably won't come out during nasty weather, so keep that in mind."""
ssn_015350_1301#0,"""Ah, you're busy? No problem."""
ssn_015350_1302#0,"""Stop by again whenever you got some time, kay?"""
ssn_015350_1401#0,"""Yoohoo! You're back."""
ssn_015350_1402#0,"""Yes! That! The \""Famed Stia Crab\""!"""
ssn_015350_1403#0,"""Here, lemme see it for a sec."""
ssn_015350_1404#0,"""...Oh yeah. Once again, fairly high quality."""
ssn_015350_1405#0,"""As to why they can only be found during calm weather, well..."""
ssn_015350_1406#0,"""They must be able to sense when Mediola's weather is about to change and they go into hiding."""
ssn_015350_1407#0,"""Otherwise, they'd get burnt to a crisp by the magma spouts."""
ssn_015350_1408#0,"""When I got some time, I'll try lookin' into it further. When I'm not trying to find new flavors, that is."""
ssn_015350_1409#0,"""So yeah, here... I got the data I needed, so now you can do whatever you want with it."""
ssn_015350_1410#0,"""Though personally, I'd see what it tastes like first..."""
ssn_015350_2001#0,"""Hm? You want to learn about more rare ingredients?"""
ssn_015350_2002#0,"""Nope. Not tellin' you yet!"""
ssn_015350_2003#0,"""Gotta save the good stuff for last."""
ssn_015350_2101#0,"""Yoohoo! You're lookin' lively today."""
ssn_015350_2102#0,"""The big battle might be over, but the fighting still continues, it seems."""
ssn_015350_2103#0,"""I thought I could really start focusing on finding tasty ingredients, but I guess things are never that simple..."""
ssn_015350_2104#0,"""So hey, why don't I tell you about the next rare ingredient?"""
ssn_015350_2201#0,"""Today's subject is the \""Famed Stia Mushroom\""."""
ssn_015350_2202#0,"""Sounds like they can be found in Outer Mediola: Sector 1."""
ssn_015350_2203#0,"""But they can only be found at night, so keep that in mind."""
ssn_015350_2301#0,"""Ahh, makes sense that you'd still be pretty busy."""
ssn_015350_2302#0,"""No probs. You know where to find me!"""
ssn_015350_2401#0,"""Yoohoo! Looks like you didn't have any issues out there."""
ssn_015350_2402#0,"""There it is! No doubt about it, that right there is a \""Famed Stia Mushroom\""."""
ssn_015350_2403#0,"""You've got quite the knack for this sorta thing!"""
ssn_015350_2404#0,"""Alright, I'm just gonna take a closer look."""
ssn_015350_2405#0,"""...Uh... This is..."""
ssn_015350_2406#0,"""...The highest quality specimen I've ever laid eyes on!"""
ssn_015350_2407#0,"""I wonder what it tastes like."""
ssn_015350_2408#0,"""It's one of the things where my colleagues would be like, \""Do NOT eat this\""."""
ssn_015350_2409#0,"""But hey, it's yours to use however you want."""
ssn_015350_2410#0,"""...As for me, I definitely... think it's better to eat it, though."""
ssn_015350_2411#0,"""Anyways, have fun finding more rare ingredients!"""
ssn_015350_2501#0,"""Yoohoo! Having fun finding rare ingredients?"""
ssn_015350_2502#0,"""In the unlikely event you find some rare ingredients that I didn't know about, tell me right away!"""
