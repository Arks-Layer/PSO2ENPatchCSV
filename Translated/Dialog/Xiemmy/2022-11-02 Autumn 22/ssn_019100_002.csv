ssn_019100_002_0006#0,"""It seems to be some sort of variant of Tetracite."""

ssn_019100_002_2107#0,"""The researchers call it an Autumn Lattice... I-I think..."""
ssn_019100_002_2108#0,"""S-So the thing is, they can also be obtained from Seasonal Enemies..."""
ssn_019100_002_2109#0,"""But they are much less common. P-Probably..."""
