ssn_012070_0002#0,"""Actually, I have a request for you that pertains to that very subject..."""
ssn_012070_0003#0,"""In order to support ARKS as an Operator, I'm currently conducting my own research on various enemies."""
ssn_012070_0004#0,"""Would you let me monitor your condition while you fight various enemies out in the field?"""
ssn_012070_0005#0,"""You will? Thank you so much!"""
ssn_012070_0006#0,"""Out of all of the Operators at Command, I'm actually the newest one here. I want to catch up to the others as quickly as I can."""

ssn_012070_0201#0,"""If there's anything I can do for you as an Operator, simply say the word."""
ssn_012070_0202#0,"""I hope to be able to make life easier for everyone to the best of my abilities."""
ssn_012070_0301#0,"""This mission is surely going to be fraught with peril. We'll be running support for you with everything we've got!"""
ssn_012070_0302#0,"""Best of luck out there!"""
