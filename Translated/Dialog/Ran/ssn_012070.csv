ssn_012070_0002#0,"""Actually, I have a request for you that pertains to that very subject..."""
ssn_012070_0003#0,"""In order to support ARKS as an Operator, I'm currently conducting my own research on various enemies."""
ssn_012070_0004#0,"""Would you let me monitor your condition while you fight various enemies out in the field?"""
ssn_012070_0005#0,"""You will? Thank you so much!"""
ssn_012070_0006#0,"""Out of all of the Operators at Command, I'm actually the newest one here. I want to catch up to the others as quickly as I can."""
ssn_012070_0007#0,"""So in order to do that, I was thinking I'd first expand my knowledge of our enemies."""
ssn_012070_0008#0,"""Therefore, I want to take measurements of the \""PSE Burst\"" phenomenon that's brought about by changes in the atmospheric PSE."""

ssn_012070_0201#0,"""If there's anything I can do for you as an Operator, simply say the word."""
ssn_012070_0202#0,"""I want to make things as easy as I can for everyone."""
ssn_012070_0301#0,"""This mission is surely going to be fraught with peril. We'll be running support for you with everything we've got!"""
ssn_012070_0302#0,"""Best of luck out there!"""
