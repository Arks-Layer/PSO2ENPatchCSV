ssn_015451_0010#0,"""I appreciate it."""
ssn_015451_0020#0,"""This time I'd like you to investigate what are known as \""Ore Clusters\""."""
ssn_015451_0030#0,"""They were reportedly sighted at Felusa Ridge, just beyond Dreisen Plant."""
ssn_015451_0040#0,"""They're like a huge mass of different Ores that melted and got fused together due to high temperatures."""
ssn_015451_0050#0,"""If the individual composition of each Ore is unaffected, it'd be a good way to get a huge quantity of various Ores all at once."""
ssn_015451_0060#0,"""However, these Ore Clusters seem to be quite hard to break."""
ssn_015451_0070#0,"""Apparently, superficial attacks don't make a single scratch on them."""
ssn_015451_0080#0,"""If it turns out that ordinary weapons don't work, I'm not sure how we could break them open..."""
ssn_015451_0090#0,"""At any rate, I want you to go to Felusa Ridge and try to locate these Ore Clusters."""
ssn_015451_0100#0,"""Thanks again."""
