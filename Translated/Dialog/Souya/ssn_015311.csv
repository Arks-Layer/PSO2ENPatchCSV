ssn_015311_0020#0,"""What I'd like you to help me out with is an investigation into potentially locally-sourceable materials."""
ssn_015311_0030#0,"""We periodically receive supplies from Central City, but that alone doesn't fully meet demands."""
ssn_015311_0040#0,"""We've been forced to scrape together what usable things we can find within Stia to make up for it."""
ssn_015311_0050#0,"""What I'm currently interested in is this rumor of \""mysterious boxes\"" that have been modified to be imperceptible to the eye."""
ssn_015311_0060#0,"""These \""Invisible Boxes\"" are reported to have been discovered in Dreisen Plant, to the north."""
ssn_015311_0070#0,"""We're unclear how they work, or how to make them appear, but they're reported to contain valuable items."""
ssn_015311_0080#0,"""This is what I'd like you to look into."""
ssn_015311_0090#0,"""If we can get more information on these Invisible Boxes, we might be able to resolve our supply shortage."""
ssn_015311_0100#0,"""You should be able to use your Mag's Active Sonar to track their location. Good luck out there."""
ssn_015311_0110#0,"""Ah, I almost forgot. This investigation only pertains to the boxes themselves."""
ssn_015311_0120#0,"""So don't worry, I won't ask you to hand over the items you find inside them."""
