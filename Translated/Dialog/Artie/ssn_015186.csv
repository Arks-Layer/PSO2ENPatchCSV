ssn_015186_0002#0,"""This time, let's talk about the Advanced Trainia \""Cannonball Rumble\""."""
ssn_015186_0003#0,"""The unique feature with that one involves the use of these giant orbs we call Cannonballs."""
ssn_015186_0004#0,"""When you defeat enemies, those orbs appear. If you use those orbs to hit the floating targets, even more enemies will show up."""
ssn_015186_0005#0,"""Rinse and repeat. It's a training regimen, but it feels kinda like a sport."""
ssn_015186_0006#0,"""There's quite a large number of targets, so you'll probably want to bring some friends with you to help."""
ssn_015186_0007#0,"""...Anyways, you'll get a better idea if you just go see for yourself."""
ssn_015186_0008#0,"""You should definitely give it a try."""
