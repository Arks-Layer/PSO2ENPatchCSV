ssn_005060_0001#0,"""Welcome to Central City!"""
ssn_005060_0002#0,"""It's always nice to meet new people! Let's all kick butt out there!"""
ssn_005060_0101#0,"""Say, do you know about adding Special Abilities to your equipment?"""
ssn_005060_0051#0,"""If you don't, I'll be happy to explain it to you!"""
ssn_005060_0052#0,"""Alright! Then listen up!"""
ssn_005060_0102#0,"""Basically, Special Abilities are little bonuses that tweak the performance of your weapons and armor."""
ssn_005060_0103#0,"""Next time you've got your equipment data in front of you, take a careful look at it"""
ssn_005060_0104#0,"""Basically, you can mix Special Abilities with different equipment, or even match Special Abilities across all of them."""
ssn_005060_0105#0,"""You should give it a shot at least once."""
ssn_005060_0106#0,"""You can add Special Abilities down at the Item Lab. But you'll need \""Special Ability Capsules\"" if you want to try it yourself..."""
ssn_005060_0107#0,"""But wait, there's more!"""
ssn_005060_0108#0,"""I'll give you some of my Special Ability Capsules! Take them down to the Lab and try them out!"""
ssn_005060_0201#0,"""So, what do you think of Special Ability tuning now that you've tried it?"""
ssn_005060_0202#0,"""One Special Ability won't make much of a difference--it's when you add a bunch onto a single piece that you really notice the improvements."""
ssn_005060_0203#0,"""Try to customize to fit your own style, and just have fun with it!"""
ssn_005060_0301#0,"""No? Well if you ever want to hear it, I'll be right here!"""
