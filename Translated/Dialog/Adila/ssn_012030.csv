ssn_012030_0101#0,"""You're that new arrival Bruder mentioned! I've heard all about you! You're learning about how to get the edge in battle, right?"""
ssn_012030_0102#0,"""Let's see...<br>Do you know about adding Special Abilities to your equipment?"""
ssn_012030_0103#0,"""If you don't, I'll be happy to explain it to you!"""
ssn_012030_0104#0,"""Alright! Then listen up!"""
ssn_012030_0105#0,"""Basically, Special Abilities are little bonuses that tweak the performance of your weapons and armor."""
ssn_012030_0106#0,"""Next time you've got your equipment data in front of you, take a careful look at it."""
ssn_012030_0107#0,"""So... You can put multiple Special Abilities on the same piece of equipment, and even swap them out for different ones."""
ssn_012030_0108#0,"""You can add Special Abilities down at the Item Lab. But you'll need \""Special Ability Capsules\"" if you want to try it yourself..."""
ssn_012030_0109#0,"""I'll give you some of my Special Ability Capsules! Take them down to the Lab and try them out!"""
ssn_012030_0201#0,"""No? Well if you ever want to hear it, I'll be right here!"""
