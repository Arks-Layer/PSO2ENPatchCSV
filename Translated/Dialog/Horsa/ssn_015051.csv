ssn_015051_0101#0,"""Yeah? Thanks a ton. It's pretty straightforward stuff."""
ssn_015051_0102#0,"""Surely you've found a few of them Red Containers, yeah?"""
ssn_015051_0103#0,"""I just recently got a mission from the boss to investigate those Red Containers, but there's a bit of a snag."""
ssn_015051_0104#0,"""You see, when I'm out on survey missions like this, I get totally lost almost immediately... I've not no sense of direction at all."""
ssn_015051_0105#0,"""I'm good at fighting, but... even with the Mag guiding me, I lose track of where I have and haven't been... Ugh, this is embarrassing."""
ssn_015051_0106#0,"""The weather up here certainly doesn't help, either... At this rate, I'm gonna embarrass my ARKS buddies back in Retem."""
ssn_015051_0107#0,"""That's why I've swallowed my pride and decided to ask you to help me out."""
