ssn_019090_002_0001#0,"""Hey, thanks for showing up. Lemme introduce myself once more."""
ssn_019090_002_0002#0,"""My name is Xitrae. I'm with Central City's Supply Corps. We handle supplies and resources that support our daily lives as well as our daily battles."""
ssn_019090_002_0003#0,"""So, moving to the issue at hand..."""
ssn_019090_002_0004#0,"""To thank ARKS for all their hard work, the Supply Corps has been working with Logistics to throw a party."""
ssn_019090_002_0005#0,"""As a surprise, we had made a bunch of these peculiar little white round treats called Tsukimi Dango."""
ssn_019090_002_0006#0,"""But, get this... While we were having them transported by truck, some of them went missing."""
ssn_019090_002_0007#0,"""As a member of the Transportation Division, this is absolutely humiliating!"""
ssn_019090_002_0008#0,"""After everyone put so much effort into making them! Oh, as soon as I find out where, when, and WHO has them, I'll...!"""
ssn_019090_002_0009#0,"""... Ahem. Let's just say that's a bit of the anger that's been running around in my head."""
ssn_019090_002_0010#0,"""... And, while I'd love to look for the culprit myself, I've got my hands full with setting up the rest of the party."""
ssn_019090_002_0011#0,"""And so I was like, hey, it'd be really cool if I could get you to help me out with this... and stuff."""
ssn_019090_002_0012#0,"""I've contacted a few of the people who were at the scene, so could I ask you to hear what they have to say?"""
ssn_019090_002_0013#0,"""I fully intend to thank you properly."""
ssn_019090_002_0014#0,"""Alright, thanks again!"""
ssn_019090_002_0015#0,"""<%me>! Thanks for showing up."""
ssn_019090_002_0016#0,"""So, moving right to the issue at hand..."""
ssn_019090_002_0017#0,"""Welcome back! How did it go? Find anything out?"""
ssn_019090_002_0018#0,"""When I find out who's responsible, I PROMISE you they'll wish they had NEVER--"""
ssn_019090_002_0019#0,"""... Okay, stay cool, Xitrae. Stay cool..."""
ssn_019090_002_0020#0,"""Deep breaths... In and out..."""
ssn_019090_002_0021#0,"""Alright. Can you try to sum up what they said for me?"""
ssn_019090_002_0022#0,"""..."""
ssn_019090_002_0023#0,"""I see... A small, round... \""something\""... with hands."""
ssn_019090_002_0024#0,"""I... see..."""
ssn_019090_002_0025#0,"""Huh? What could that be...?"""
ssn_019090_002_0026#0,"""Can you make any sense of that description?"""
ssn_019090_002_0027#0,"""Oh yeah! Doesn't get much more \""round\"" than those guys!"""
ssn_019090_002_0028#0,"""But, Gororons aren't exactly small, are they?"""
ssn_019090_002_0029#0,"""Oh! Those portly little critters! A Tames, huh... I never thought of that."""
ssn_019090_002_0030#0,"""But... Could a Sunny really do something like that...?"""
ssn_019090_002_0031#0,"""Ah, those fellas who never miss a work-out day? They DO always carry around those boulders..."""
ssn_019090_002_0032#0,"""But, Za Oodan Loas aren't exactly round, are they?"""
ssn_019090_002_0033#0,"""Hmmm... It's probably something else..."""
ssn_019090_002_0034#0,"""Oh, I know! Let's just use the Dango to lure out the culprit! <%me>, will you give me a hand?"""
ssn_019090_002_0035#0,"""... Round, small, and has hands..."""
ssn_019090_002_0036#0,"""I see. So that's what they meant..."""
ssn_019090_002_0037#0,"""Quick, try chasing that Tsukimi Rappy!"""
ssn_019090_002_0038#0,"""Welcome back. Sorry for all the trouble."""
ssn_019090_002_0039#0,"""... Really though, who would've thought the culprit was a Rappy?"""
ssn_019090_002_0040#0,"""If it was a DOLL, I would have absolutely no mercy, but... Well, Rappies will be Rappies, I guess."""
ssn_019090_002_0041#0,"""If word gets out that we got bamboozled by one of THOSE, oh, my boss would just cry..."""
ssn_019090_002_0042#0,"""I'm just gonna... write this all up as an unfortunate run-in with an enemy raid."""
ssn_019090_002_0043#0,"""... They say that Tsukimi Dango share a likeness with how our moon, Gaeira, shines in the sky around this time of year."""
ssn_019090_002_0044#0,"""Apparently, if you eat only as many as the number of years you've lived, something good will happen to you."""
ssn_019090_002_0045#0,"""That's why I wanted to make sure we had more than enough for all the ARKS to eat."""
ssn_019090_002_0046#0,"""But... since those are gone, we'll just have to make that much more this year."""
ssn_019090_002_0047#0,"""Gonna be a huge pain in the butt to resupply all those materials..."""
ssn_019090_002_0048#0,"""Anyways, if it interests you, you should try eating some yourself."""
ssn_019090_002_0049#0,"""Welp, I guess that problem's settled."""
ssn_019090_002_0050#0,"""Settled? Is it really settled, though? ... Ah, let's just say it is."""
ssn_019090_002_0051#0,"""I'm just gonna move on to the next job."""
ssn_019090_002_0052#0,"""Anyways, thanks so much for your help. I hope I can count on you again sometime in the future."""
ssn_019090_002_0053#0,"""See you around!"""
ssn_019090_002_0054#0,"""In battle, supplies are like a lifeline!"""
ssn_019090_002_0055#0,"""We can't let some teensy little enemy raid get the best of us!"""
