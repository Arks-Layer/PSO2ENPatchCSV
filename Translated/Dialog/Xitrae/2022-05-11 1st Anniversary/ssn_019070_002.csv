ssn_019070_002_0001#0,"""Thanks for coming. Let me introduce myself again."""
ssn_019070_002_0002#0,"""I'm Xitrae. I'm from the Central City Supply Corps, and I'm in charge of managing supplies to support combat operations."""
ssn_019070_002_0003#0,"""So, lately we've been running into way stronger enemies. So many people are getting hurt that the medical team can't handle it all."""
ssn_019070_002_0004#0,"""So, I'm here to give ARKS advice about upgrading their weapons, so they can take those big baddies on."""
ssn_019070_002_0005#0,"""I don't wanna stick my nose in where isn't wanted, but could you run through this program too?"""
ssn_019070_002_0006#0,"""First up, we've gotta get you some funds. If you want to get paid fast, my advice is to go and pick up some Alpha Reactors."""
ssn_019070_002_0007#0,"""They're all over Aelio, so you shouldn't have any trouble finding them if you poke around a bit."""
ssn_019070_002_0008#0,"""Okay, good luck!"""
ssn_019070_002_0009#0,"""Hey, how are ya? I've been busy trying to keep our supply lines open."""
ssn_019070_002_0010#0,"""Welcome back! Ok, so we've got you everything you need to grind your weapons..."""
ssn_019070_002_0011#0,"""Now, have you ever heard of an enemy called Captan?"""
ssn_019070_002_0012#0,"""It started showing up around the same time as these stronger enemies, but it doesn't seem to be one of them. It's not a DOLL or an Alters."""
ssn_019070_002_0013#0,"""...Well, I guess I should leave figuring out what it is up to Xiandy or Ran..."""
ssn_019070_002_0014#0,"""The important thing is, Captan drops a ton of Special Ability Capsules. That makes it a vital part of our weapon upgrade program."""
ssn_019070_002_0015#0,"""...We might not know what it is, but it sure is helpful."""
ssn_019070_002_0016#0,"""So, get out there and find yourself a Captan."""
ssn_019070_002_0017#0,"""The strength of your equipment depends on it."""
ssn_019070_002_0018#0,"""Oh hey, you're back!"""
ssn_019070_002_0019#0,"""Now you're ready to get your upgrade on. Just head on over to the Item Lab."""
ssn_019070_002_0020#0,"""It's up to you to figure out which weapons to tune up, and how much you want to do it."""
ssn_019070_002_0021#0,"""By the way, when you're done, it would be great if you could put those weapons to use taking out some enemies for us."""
ssn_019070_002_0022#0,"""Alright! That's the end of this program! I wonder if any of it was even new to you...?"""
ssn_019070_002_0023#0,"""Thanks for going through it for me, anyway."""
ssn_019070_002_0024#0,"""Oh, and if your friends ever have trouble upgrading their weapons, it would mean a lot to me if you'd pass my advice on to them."""
ssn_019070_002_0025#0,"""Alright, thanks again!"""
ssn_019070_002_0026#0,"""Supply lines are the backbone of any fighting force! We won't let a few puffed-up enemies stop us getting through!"""
ssn_019070_002_0027#0,"""Keep on improving your mind, body and gear so you can do your best out there as well!"""
