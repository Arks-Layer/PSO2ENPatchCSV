ssn_015061_0101#0,"""Alright, now let's talk."""
ssn_015061_0102#0,"""Well, before that, we'll have to talk about Rayjord Gorge."""
ssn_015061_0103#0,"""It's been said that it's home to mysterious and particularly powerful enemies."""
ssn_015061_0104#0,"""However, you'll need adequate provisions to stave off the elements if you hope to even encounter one."""
ssn_015061_0105#0,"""Leso, our quartermaster here, just so happens to deal in such provisions."""
ssn_015061_0106#0,"""Alas, being that said provisions are quite hard to come by, she can't just give them to you for free."""
ssn_015061_0107#0,"""If you want some, you'll have to offer things in return."""
ssn_015061_0108#0,"""You'll want to provide Notable Kvaris Ackee and Notable Kvaris Squid."""
ssn_015061_0109#0,"""First, gathering Notable Kvaris Ackee comes with a caveat."""
ssn_015061_0110#0,"""They can be found in Northern Kvaris, but only during the morning and noon."""
ssn_015061_0111#0,"""Ackees gathered outside of those hours aren't of a good enough quality."""
ssn_015061_0112#0,"""Take note of what time it is, and go gather some when you can."""
