ssn_014911_0101#0,"""Alright, here's the deal. First, it's about the Trainia..."""
ssn_014911_0102#0,"""We know that Kvaris natives from long ago made use of 'em. But go figure, they weren't the ones who made the Cocoons or the Towers it seems."""
ssn_014911_0103#0,"""For example, the Photon transfer devices. You know, the things that warp you around in the Trainia. The Ryuker Devices use similar technology."""
ssn_014911_0104#0,"""Apparently, Kvaris used to be known for their technological advancement."""
ssn_014911_0105#0,"""...but not enough to be able to actually build those things, it seems."""
ssn_014911_0106#0,"""...So if they didn't make the Trainia, then who did?"""
ssn_014911_0107#0,"""Actually... There's been a hypothesis floating around the scientific community. It's still full of uncertainties, so we haven't been able to go public with it yet."""
ssn_014911_0108#0,"""In order to test the hypothesis, I'm gonna need you to get me as much data as you can."""
ssn_014911_0109#0,"""Like, data from all of the Cocoons. Yeah I know, I know it's a tall order, but I could really use your help. Please?"""
