ssn_014912_0101#0,"""Alright, so here's the deal."""
ssn_014912_0102#0,"""It's about the hypothesis that's been floating around in the scientific community."""
ssn_014912_0103#0,"""Way back when, way before even Lost Central was called Central City..."""
ssn_014912_0104#0,"""There likely existed a highly-advanced civilization on Halpha."""
ssn_014912_0105#0,"""This civilization had astonishing levels of technology... And they were likely the ones who made the Trainia."""
ssn_014912_0106#0,"""They likely had a hand in creating other stuff too, like Ryuker Devices and Updrafters."""
ssn_014912_0107#0,"""Stuff like Transport Trucks and Mining Rigs--we can't take full credit for their design, you know."""
ssn_014912_0108#0,"""But... one day, that civilization vanished for some reason or another. They just up and left their technology behind."""
ssn_014912_0109#0,"""We're pretty confident in this hypothesis. It's just that we lack all the information to be able to prove it definitively."""
ssn_014912_0110#0,"""So, will you help me out again? I'm gonna need data from the Tower in this region next. Thanks again!"""
