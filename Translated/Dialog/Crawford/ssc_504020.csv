ssc_504020_0010#0,"""Hey, you're here at a good time."""
ssc_504020_0020#0,"""I've just finished gathering research materials regarding Retem."""
ssc_504020_0030#0,"""I'm not sure if they'll be useful in your battles, but why not take a look?"""
ssc_504020_0040#0,"""Sounds interesting."""
ssc_504020_0050#0,"""If they're not useful for battle, then..."""
ssc_504020_0060#0,"""Good. Alright, let me explain."""
ssc_504020_0070#0,"""Oh don't be like that."""
ssc_504020_0080#0,"""First, regarding Retem's environment."""
ssc_504020_0090#0,"""Retem is a region covered in sand,<br>as I'm sure you're well aware."""
ssc_504020_0100#0,"""It rarely rains there, and its temperature fluctuates based on the time of day."""
ssc_504020_0110#0,"""It could be said that it's considerably hostile to life."""
ssc_504020_0120#0,"""But in actuality, a great many lifeforms have<br>adapted just to live in that environment."""
ssc_504020_0130#0,"""Including enemies, which is the part I plan to focus on investigating."""
ssc_504020_0140#0,"""However, I find it mysterious that two regions can have such contrasting<br>environments, despite being separated by just those Border Bridges."""
ssc_504020_0150#0,"""I'd like to assign people to that as well, but first I'd like to<br>prioritize things pertaining to battle and survival."""
ssc_504020_0160#0,"""Speaking of mysterious, there's the Sagaan Mountainpass you encounter as soon as you enter the region."""
ssc_504020_0170#0,"""There's a strange electro-gravitational field occuring there."""
ssc_504020_0180#0,"""Heavy boulders and such floating in the air is quite the sight."""
ssc_504020_0190#0,"""The field seems to be caused by the large cylindrical structures known as \""Deglevs\"", but they're just as mysterious."""
ssc_504020_0200#0,"""... Since this chat looks to be a long one, I might as well..."""
ssc_504020_0210#0,"""Next, let's also talk about the people of Retem."""
ssc_504020_0220#0,"""One may well say that Retem is a harsh desert environment, but the constant<br>threat of DOLLS makes it just that much more inhospitable."""
ssc_504020_0230#0,"""To us, our encounter with Nex Aelio was the most dire of crises."""
ssc_504020_0240#0,"""But in Retem, that sort of encounter is a daily occurrence.<br>They have sacrificed much and more for the sake of their town."""
ssc_504020_0250#0,"""Above all, I hold the deepest respect<br>for the strength of their people."""
ssc_504020_0260#0,"""They uphold values and principles that involve<br>the strong protecting and guiding the weak."""
ssc_504020_0270#0,"""Each with their own circumstances, Aelio and Retem<br>have seldom been able to interact with one another."""
ssc_504020_0280#0,"""Our cultures differing such that they do, I think it may take time for the two to be able to open up."""
ssc_504020_0290#0,"""Above all the circumstances, they are accepting of those<br>who can display their strength, as you have."""
ssc_504020_0300#0,"""積極的に行動し続けることで、<br>リテムアークスたちの信頼を得られるようにしてほしい。"""
ssc_504020_0310#0,"""……とまあ、リテムの基本的な情報は<br>こんなところかな。"""
ssc_504020_0320#0,"""次は、キミが実際に体験したことを、<br>聞かせてくれると嬉しい。"""
ssc_504020_0330#0,"""土産話を待っているよ。"""
