skit04#0,"""In any case! You also get to take items corresponding to the amount of Stage Orders you completed!"""
skit05#0,"""Pick whichever items you'd like from the Extreme Terminal. Now then. Good work!"""
skit06#0,"""Also, as a service to you, we're going to give you Catalysts to change the Spellstones into other types of Spellstones!"""
